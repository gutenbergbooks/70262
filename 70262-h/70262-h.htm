</div>

<p>There has been no attempt in this brief work to
record every mention of the tithe that may be
found in ancient writings. Some have called attention
to a large group of references which lie in
the era contemporaneous with the history of
Israel. Items of history, for example, from 500
to 800 B. C. are interesting, but would not add
materially to the argument. In a way they may
help to solve the question as to the meaning of
terms used in the pre-Mosaic period. Many prefer
to be cautious about asserting that there was
a religious tithe in this remote period. Mr. Johns
in his valuable work, “Assyrian Deeds and Documents”
Vol. III, says, for example, (pp. 347-349),
that to translate a certain word “tithe” as some
do is to “assume that there was a tithe.” He
admits, however, that this view “agrees admirably
with that universally adopted custom among
Semitic peoples of paying a tithe to the government.”
On the other hand Prof. Sayce positively
asserts that there is a word which should be translated
tithe. The cautious ones say that he jumps
at conclusions. Some who do not jump stand
ever still and reach no conclusions. Which is better,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
I do not undertake to say. It has been the
aim of this work to take a broad view of tribute,
not distinctly as paid to a priest, but to kings as
well. Rulers often assumed the function of a
priest and appropriated the revenue to themselves.
While the meaning of terms and the use of revenue
may be in a somewhat doubtful state, there
seems to be no question but that the proportion
of the tenth prevailed as has been stated.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment is gratefully made of the kind
help of Dr. R. F. Harper, Prof. of Assyriology,
and Dr. J. H. Breasted, Professor of Egyptology
in the University of Chicago, for valuable direction
as to books that might be read to advantage.
I desire to express my appreciation of the advice
and encouragement of Mr. Thos. Kane and other
friends who have urged me to present this study
to the public. I trust it may increase the tribute
to the King of glory, the Head of the Church.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION.<br>

<small>WHAT WE OWE, AND WHY WE DON’T PAY IT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>No one not an unreasoning optimist believes
that with our present methods of Church finance,
it is possible that the World will be Christianized
during the Twentieth Century. No one not an
unreasoning pessimist believes that if all Christians
practiced the Tithe System and devoted one-tenth
of their income to the Master’s work that
the World could not be brought to a knowledge of
Christ within the next one hundred years. These
two facts being conceded, and no thinking man
will deny them, three questions suggest themselves:—</p>

<p>1st. Who is most to blame for present conditions?</p>

<p>2nd. The Results,</p>

<p>3rd. The Remedy.</p>

<p>Answering the first question as to who is most
to blame, it is my deliberate conviction based on
more than twenty-five years varied experience and
growing more decided each year, that the blame
very largely lies at the doors of our Theological
Seminaries and Theological Professors, the teachers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
of our teachers. They must bear a very large
share of the responsibility.</p>

<p>There will be, there can be no permanent
change for the better while our religious teachers
are taught to teach us a lot of generalities which
do not have even the merit of being glittering on
this, of all subjects connected with the Christian
life of laymen and lay-women, the most important.</p>

<p>There will be slow progress so long as such a
large proportion of students for the ministry are
taught that we laymen and lay-women owe everything
to God in general but nothing in particular,
nothing definite; that the time of payment, manner
of payment, and even the amount of payment
of whatever we owe, or think we owe, or somebody
else tells us we owe, is left entirely to our
natural disposition to benevolence or stinginess or
to our moods and caprices. That <i>payment</i> to
God of any definite proportion of our income does
not enter into the Christian system; that all our
benevolences are to be classed under the general
term of “Giving,” thus placing our Heavenly
Father and the street beggar to whom we may
give a few pennies, in the same category. That it
is right and not an insult to the Almighty to teach
us that we can <i>give money</i> to God; that the basis
and foundation of the Christian system of providing
means for carrying on the Master’s work in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
discipling all Nations is founded on a few sentences
from a letter Paul wrote to the Christians
in Corinth, urging them to make a generous
free-will offering in aid of some suffering fellow
Christians down at Jerusalem. For obvious reasons,
the reason he gives for urgency in the matter
is very rarely quoted: “That there be no collections
when I come.” Paul evidently had his
share of human nature, and special collections
which most Ministers so much dread was probably
also his pet aversion.</p>

<p>During the past year I have had a very striking
confirmation of this opinion. On September
29th, 1902, I sent a copy of the following letter
to the President or leading official in each of the
Evangelical Theological Seminaries in the United
States and Canada, 152 in all:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Sir—By this mail I send you a sample package
of such literature as I publish on the subject of “Honoring
God with our Substance.” I will take pleasure in
sending gratis, express prepaid, a sufficient number of
similar packages to supply one for each theological student
under your care if you or some one in your institution
will state how many will be required and agree that
they shall be placed in the hands of the students. Hoping
to hear from you, I am</p>

<p class="center">Yours very truly,</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>Just twenty-seven accepted the offer, thus
showing that nearly five-sixths of those to whom
the letters were addressed were not willing or
indifferent as to whether the students under their
care should be taught that the debt we owe to
God means anything definite.</p>

<p>In November of the same year I sent a similar
letter addressed to the “Professor of Practical
Theology” in the 125 institutions where the first
offer was not accepted. A total of 22 responded
and expressed a willingness some of them an
earnest desire to distribute literature on Tithing
among the students. Next I tried to reach the
students direct, as I had failed to reach them by
the first two methods in more than two-thirds of
the Seminaries of our country and Canada. Once
more I had written and personally signed 103 letters,
the envelope being addressed “To That
Student Most Interested in the Subject of ‘Honoring
God with our Substance.’” The letter enclosed
was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>To the student receiving this letter:—</p>

<p>Dear Sir—By this mail I send you samples of such
literature as I publish on the subject of “Honoring God
with our Substance.” I will take pleasure in sending
gratis, express prepaid, a sufficient number of similar
packages to supply one for each Theological student in
your Seminary, if you will state how many will be required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
and agree that they shall be placed in the hands
of the students.</p>

<p>When you engage in your life work you will find no
subject of such vital interest to laymen, and a thorough
understanding of it, and ability to explain it, will greatly
aid you in Church and Missionary support.</p>

<p>Awaiting your reply, and hoping for your co-operation,
I remain</p>

<p class="center">Yours very truly,</p>
</div>

<p>To my great surprise only ten accepted this
offer, leaving 93 institutions devoted to training
preachers either indifferent or unwilling to permit
their students to accept and read, without
expense, the same literature on the subject of
Tithing that active Pastors have ordered in quantities
aggregating many millions during the last
27 years for circulation among their people.</p>

<p>In contrast with so much apathy and indifference
or opposition, many of the replies received
were of the most encouraging character, the writers
expressing deep interest in the subject and
promising hearty co-operation.</p>

<p>Another obstacle, and second only in importance,
is found in the attitude of a large proportion
of the editors of our Religious Newspapers.
It should be remembered in their behalf that
nearly all of them are Ministers, and as a result
are themselves the victims of false teaching or no
teaching on this subject, which to at least nine-tenths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
of their constituency, is of the most vital
importance. The few lay-editors of Religious
Newspapers that I have the honor of knowing all
believe in and practice the Tithe System.</p>

<p>As in the case of Theological Teachers, I have
very recent confirmation of this opinion.</p>

<p>A year or two ago a fellow worker in this field,
the Rev. Henry Lansdell, D. D. of Morton College,
Black Heath, England, an extensive traveler
in Oriental countries, and noted author realizing
that Religious books are read by so few people as
compared with Religious newspapers, conceived
and put into execution the unique idea of publishing
serially in slip form suitable for printers’
proof, some of the results of the latest archaeological
researches and discoveries bearing on the
subject of Tithing, supplementing and enriching
them with his own researches and interviews
with eminent archaeologists. I copy from a letter
received from him dated July 8th, 1903:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My Dear Sir—Your letter of the 23d June, quite
cheered me. I have circularized and sent slips to upwards
of 1,250 editors in 114 countries, Kingdoms and
States, sending also with my offer in 167 cases an autograph
or dictated letter. Thus far the result is approximately
as follows: No answer received from 976, and
the number who have declined is 248, whilst about 26
have accepted the series in whole or in part. The number
of copies printed of four of these publications<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
amounts to over 400,000 weekly; of the rest I do not
know the circulation, but supposing that each paper has
four readers, it does not seem at all an extravagant estimate
that the articles will be brought before two million
readers weekly. This surely is something to thank God
for!</p>

<p>Out of the 1,250, more than half were sent to America
and Canada. Not one Canadian paper thus far has accepted,
but in the United States the papers accepting
are California, 1; Arkansas, 1; Texas, 1; Ohio, 2; New
York, 1; New Jersey, 1; Pennsylvania, 1; Illinois, 1.</p>
</div>

<p>It is my belief—certainly my hope—that Dr.
Lansdell has in preparation a volume in which he
will exhaustively treat of the early history of the
Tithe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have mislaid the first three
slips, each about a newspaper column, sent me by
Dr. Lansdell, and hence am unable to give their
titles. Commencing with the fourth, the titles are
as follows:—</p>

<table>
<tr><td class="tdr">IV.</td><td> Egyptian War Tithes.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">V.</td><td> Pre-Historic and Spartan Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">VI.</td><td> Græco-Persian and Later Greece.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">VII.</td><td> The Romans.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">VIII.</td><td>  The Pelasgi, Britons and German-Saxons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">IX.</td><td> Where Did Abram Learn Tithing?</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">X.</td><td> Jacob’s Vow.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">XI.</td><td> Israel’s First Tithe.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">XII.</td><td> Israel’s Second, or Festival Tithe.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>Naturally the first three would have reference
to the very earliest history, including lately discovered
evidences of Tithing in pre-historic times.</p>

<p>One would suppose that such original and late
matter as these titles indicate, prepared by a
thorough scholar, would be gladly accepted and
published by the religious press. That it is not
carries its own comment.</p>

<p>My own experience has in some respects been
similar. To illustrate: Two or three years ago I
offered for a limited time to send gratis, express
prepaid, to Christian Endeavor societies, Epworth
Leagues, and Baptist Young People’s Unions
such literature as I publish on the subject of
Tithing sufficient to furnish one of each to every
family represented. I had the offer printed, occupying
about an inch of newspaper space, and sent
it with a personal letter asking publication to
practically all the Evangelical religious newspapers
in the United States and Canada. I kept no
accurate record of the replies, but probably one-fourth,
possibly one-third, cheerfully published
the offer; two or three editorially called attention
to it, while a few returned it with an offer to
insert it at regular advertising rates. The rest
ignored it.</p>

<p><i>As to Results.</i> These, judged by any fair
standard are not only deplorable, but a shame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
to our profession as Christian men and women.
The old lady who boasted that she had been a
Christian for twenty-five years and had never
failed to give a dollar a year to Foreign Missions
was a good deal above the average. If she had
given a like sum, less than ten cents a month, to
Home Missions, she would not have suffered by
comparison with the rest of us; and yet we are
the richest nation in the world, and while now
passing through a season of unexampled prosperity,
our gifts to Missions show very slight increase;
in many cases they are less than ordinary.
No wonder the world sneers at our profession of
love for Christ and desire to see His Kingdom
established throughout the world. They have the
right to sneer in this regard and we are the last
people in the world who have a right to criticise
them for doing it.</p>

<p>In this respect both our Heavenly Father and
the world about us occupy the same standpoint of
judgment. No matter what our profession may
be, both God and the world measure our real
interest in this as in all other subjects by what we
do for it, and for us laymen and lay-women our
doing is measured rightly and of necessity by our
contributions, the money we give.</p>

<p>So far as we are concerned I can think of but
one excuse. I admit that it is a poor one but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
is the best we have. We have either been
wrongly, or insufficiently, taught by our religious
teachers regarding this of all subjects to us the
most important. There has been little or no
“Thus saith the Lord” about it; nearly all our
teaching has been on the line of ‘Give, Give,
Give’; very little of definite <i>payment of what we
owe</i> and letting free-will offerings commence
after our debt has been paid. We have been continuously
and persistently taught that we can <i>give</i>
money to God. We have even been exhorted and
urged to be systematically benevolent in the matter
of gifts to God. Think of it! Systematic
benevolence applied to our Heavenly Father. The
whole system of our teaching on this subject has
been based on “Giving,” everlastingly “Giving.”
If this teaching is right we laymen can justly
claim the right to <i>give</i> what we please and
<i>as</i> we please. Gifts and payment occupy very
different standpoints. If I owe a debt, it is a
definite amount and I must pay it when it is due,
or be branded as a defaulter, but no man <i>owes</i> a
gift. True, we both give and pay when we pay
Tithes, but the payment is to God, the giving as
His stewards and agents is to our fellow men for
the upbuilding and advancement of His Kingdom.</p>

<p>It is only fair in this connection to say that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</span>
ministers have the same excuse, poor as it is, that
we laymen and lay-women have. They have been
the victims of wrong teaching by their professors
of theology and teachers of practical—not theoretical—religion.
The only sensible thing for us
all to do is to repent and reform.</p>

<p>That I may not be accused of overstating or
misrepresenting the situation, I copy the Pledge
of the Tenth Legion of the Christian Endeavor
Society. This Pledge has been signed by over
25,000 of the young people of our churches. It
clearly perpetuates this false teaching and will of
course bear its legitimate fruit. At the time the
Tenth Legion was started the attention of its officers
was called to the mistake as I regard it in the
language, but they declined to change it. It reads
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“Unto God the Things that are God’s”</p>

<p class="center">Enrollment Blank.</p>

<p><span class="indentleft">Please enroll my name in</span></p>

<p class="center">THE TENTH LEGION</p>

<p class="center">of the United Society of Christian Endeavor as a Christian
whose practice it is to give God the tithe, and send
me the Certificate of Membership.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</span>Another result is that while this is a Giving Age
as never before in the history of the world, the
Church is not getting her share. Christians are
giving largely, but not to Church objects nor
through Church channels. There are tens of
thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of
Tithe Payers but their Tithes are not brought into
the modern storehouse, the Church, but are directed
into numberless other channels. Habits of
giving to objects of benevolence outside the
Church are being formed, especially by the young,
which will last for life. The result is and will
continue that taking into account the increase in
wealth and increase in Giving in other lines, the
Church is not only not making advance but relatively
retrograding.</p>

<p>A further word about the results of this teaching.
The Supreme message of Christ was unselfishness.
Judging by what we professing
Christians give to spread His Name and Kingdom
outside of our own churches, which means Home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span>
and Foreign Missions, could anything appear
more intensely selfish than modern Christianity in
rich America? Boiled down, it certainly appears
to mean to the world at least, and I fear to God,
get converted, confess Christ before men, join the
church, attend church and prayer meetings, do as
little as you can and be respectable among your
neighbors towards the support of your church and
pastor, and then give less than $2.00 each per
member to Home and Foreign Missions. Yes—taking
out the amounts contributed by, say, 20
per cent of generous givers—mark I do not say
large givers, it is less than 50 cents each, or to be
liberal less than 5 cents each per month for the
conversion of the world at home and abroad, and
all this in free, rich America. In most other
countries Christians have some excuse for not
paying the Tithe to God. In most of them there
is a State Church, and the State claims the right
to enforce payment of the Tithe for the support
of that Church. Not so with us. We have no
State Church, and are accountable to God only for
the payment of the Tenth. As Mr. Stewart explains
in the following pages, the Tithe is God’s
law for the race, yet the payment—in American
churches at least—is entirely voluntary. In this
respect it does not differ from the law of the Sabbath,
or any other of God’s laws. We may refuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[xx]</span>
to obey any or all of them. Our obedience is
voluntary, but our refusal to obey does not abrogate
or repeal the laws.</p>

<p>I was rejoiced when I learned that Mr. Stewart,
the author of the following pages had been studying
this subject for years. I urged him to prosecute
the work, and publish the results of his investigations
and conclusions. I had the pleasure
of reading the manuscript before publication.
I regard his work as excellent from every
standpoint, and the best for “plain people”
I have ever seen. It will be both my pleasure
and duty to give it the widest possible circulation,
and I bespeak for it careful and prayerful
reading, more especially on the part of my
brother laymen who are seeking to know and do
their duty in this the most important practical
subject connected with our Christian life under
Twentieth Century conditions.</p>

<p><i>As to the remedy.</i> There is no immediate remedy
in sight. It is simply a question of more light,
but light never enters into purposely darkened
rooms.</p>

<p>In so far as Mr. Stewart’s little volume comes
into willing hands it will help take down the shutters
and let the light into hitherto darkened rooms.
I hope and believe it will also cause many putters-up-of-shutters
to hesitate and at least be neutral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</span>
rather than continue their thus far darkening
work.</p>

<p>When the teachings of this little volume, and
others yet to be published in the light of recent
investigations and discoveries have had time to
permeate and leaven the thinking Christian public
he will be not only a brave, but a rash, professor,
or teacher or editor who will at once advertise his
ignorance and offend a large proportion of his
pupils, or readers, by proclaiming the doctrine
that the Tithe is not God’s law for the human race
and as enduring as its author. He will not have
the courage to teach that it was a Mosaic institution,
that it was abolished by Christ, and that
Christ intended to substitute in its place as a
system of church finance the earnest plea of one
of his followers 30 or 40 years later for a generous
free-will offering from the churches in Corinth
to relieve the needs of suffering fellow
Christians in another city.</p>

<p>A natural question would be—“Do you expect
that the character of the teaching of a large majority
of the Theological Professors and writing
by editors of the religious newspapers, most of
them past middle life, will be changed by the
change in Christian public opinion on this subject,
and that they will become active teachers of
the binding obligation of the Tithe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</span>I have no such hope, but I do hope and expect
that they will be neutral and refrain from opposing.
My belief is that active opposition and indifference
can and will be stayed; but my hope is
in the next generation of professors, teachers and
preachers, and as a result a generation of laymen
and lay-women who will teach and practice that
the Tithe is—not was—God’s law for the human
race, and that the obligation to pay it is as binding
now as it ever was.</p>

<p class="ph2">THE TITHE.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ITEMS OF HISTORY.</h2>
</div>

<p>“Tithe” is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning “the
tenth.” Technically speaking, it is defined as “the
tenth of produce, property or spoils dedicated to
sacred use.” Trench quotes with approval Emerson’s
characterization of language as “fossil poetry”
and adds, “but it may be affirmed of it with
exactly the same truth that it is fossil ethics or
fossil history. Words quite as often and as effectually
embody parts of history, or convictions
of the moral sense, as of the imagination or passion
of men.” While this is true of words in such
a fascinating way, it will, no doubt, furnish the
best basis of conclusion, to trace the history of
this word and the principle which it involves. If
a word embodies history, the history of a word
may contain much information of value. This
word then will briefly be traced in both Biblical
and Extra-Biblical History.</p>

<p>FIRST: In Biblical Record it appears early.
Its <i>first</i> distinct mention is in Gen. 14:20. Abram
returning from the slaughter of the four kings
was met by Melchizedek, king of Salem, and priest
of the most high God. He blessed Abram, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
in turn recognized him as his priest before God,
and “gave him tithes of all” the spoil.</p>

<p>Its <i>second</i> is in Gen. 28:22. Jacob had been to
the gate of heaven, and none other than Bethel
could be chosen as a name for that place. Here
Jacob under the impression of the awe of God’s
presence, vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be
with me, and will keep me in this way that I go,
and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put
on, so that I come again to my father’s house in
peace; then shall the Lord be my God; and this
stone which I have set up for a pillar, shall be
God’s house; and of all that thou shalt give me
I will surely give the tenth unto thee.”</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> use is in connection with the Levitical
law. The Lord spake through Moses and gave
this commandment, which is most fully stated in
the three following places:</p>

<p>First: Lev. 27:30-32: “And all the tithe of
the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the
fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s: it is holy unto the
Lord. And if a man will at all redeem ought of
his tithes he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.
And concerning the tithe of the herd or of
the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the
rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord.”</p>

<p>Second: Num. 18:26, 30, 31: “Thus speak
unto the Levites and say unto them, When ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
take of the children of Israel the tithes which I
have given you from them for your inheritance,
then ye shall offer up a heave offering of it for the
Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe.” “Therefore
thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved
the best thereof from it, then ... ye shall eat of
it in every place, ye and your households; for it is
your reward for your service in the tabernacle of
the congregation.”</p>

<p>Third: Deut. 14:22, 23, 28, 29: “Thou shalt
truly tithe all the increase of the seed that the field
bringeth forth year by year. And thou shalt eat
before the Lord thy God in the place which he
shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of
thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and of the
firstlings of thy herd and of thy flocks; that thou
mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always.”</p>

<p>“At the end of three years thou shalt bring
forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year,
and shalt lay it up within thy gates: And the
Levite (because he hath no part nor inheritance
with thee), and the stranger, and the fatherless,
and the widow which are within thy gates, shall
come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the Lord
thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine
hand which thou doest.”</p>

<p>How long the Mosaic order was carried out we
do not know. Samuel in his protest against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Israel’s asking for a king (1st Sam. 8:15,17), tells
them that “he will take the tenth of your seed and
your vineyards and give to his officers and to his
servants.” “Also he will take the tenth of your
sheep; and ye shall be his servants.”</p>

<p>It is likely that the sacred use of the tithe was
early perverted under the kings. We hear no
more of this system until the time of Hezekiah
(726 B. C.), who instituted once more “the
courses of the priests and Levites” (2d Chron.
31:2-5, 10-12), and “commanded the people that
dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the
priests and Levites.” The people responded at
once, “and the tithes of all things brought they in
abundantly.” So abundant were they that the
chief priest reported that, “since the people began
to bring the offerings into the house of the Lord,
we have had enough to eat and have left plenty:
for the Lord hath blessed his people, and that
which is left is this great store.” So great was
this store that chambers in the house of the Lord
were prepared for it, and men were appointed to
oversee this surplus, who “brought in the offerings
and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully,”
and kept them in the places prepared for
them. Before this reformation Amos had sounded
his warning in these ironical words. Amos 4:4,5:
“Come to Bethel and transgress; at Gilgal multiply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
transgressions; and bring your sacrifices every
morning and your tithes after three years: for
this liketh you, oh, ye children of Israel, saith the
Lord God.”</p>

<p>The prophets cry out all along the line against
the greed and selfishness of the people. The captivity
even did not burn out this root of evil, and
Nehemiah is called upon to right the neglect of
the command, “Honor the Lord with thy substance.”
(Prov. 3:9.) He joins with the people
in a determination to bring the first-fruits and the
tithes unto the priests and Levites, that (Neh.
10:37, 38, 39) the “Levites might have the tithes
in all the cities of our tillage.” “And the Levites
shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the
house of our God.” “And we will not forsake the
house of our God.” But fickle Jewry was soon
denying the charge of robbery at the mouth of
Malachi who says: “Ye have robbed God in
tithes and offerings and are cursed with a curse.”
(Mal. 3:10.) “Bring ye all the tithes into the
storehouse,” that blessings, spiritual, temporal and
national, may be poured out upon you. What
Malachi denounced, Nehemiah rectified by one
bold stroke. He gathered the Levites and singers
from the fields, whither they had gone to earn a
livelihood, and set them in their places. Once
more the old order was restored, and it was true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
that all Judah (Neh. 13:12) “brought the tithe
of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the
treasuries.”</p>

<p>When the New Testament opens its pages of
history we find the tithe principle very scrupulously
observed by the “rigidly righteous,” and
perhaps by a majority of the Jewish people. The
7th chapter of Hebrews makes use of the word
tithe to show that the priesthood of Christ, who
is after the order of Melchizedek, is superior to
the priesthood of the Levites, because they in the
loins of their father Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek.
Barring this chapter there are just six
other places where the tenth, or tithe, occurs.
Three of these (John 1:39; Rev. 11:13; 21:23)
are simple numerals. Of the remaining three, two
refer to the same incident as recorded in Matt.
23:23, and Luke 11:42. The well-known words
of Matthew, who gives the fullest statement, are
these: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin,
and have left undone the weightier matters
of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith: but
these ye ought to have done, and not to have left
the other undone.” The other reference is equally
well-known and occurs in the prayer of the Pharisee,
who said, (Luke 18:12.) “I give tithes of all
that I get.” The Revised Version is used in giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
these quotations because it more correctly
translates the verb in the first references which
should also be translated “tithe” in the last reference,
for the Greek verb is the same in all three.</p>

<p>SECOND: The Extra-Biblical records have
frequent references to the tithe, the number and
extent of which can only be hinted at in the brief
selections given.</p>

<p>Since the time of Selden who wrote his famous
“Historie of Tithes” almost 300 years ago (the
edition to which I have access was published in
1618), little seems to have been added to the historical
data respecting the tithe by those who
write upon that phase of the subject. Every reference
book in the various libraries of this city,
and all the literature on the tithe, so far as consulted,
have the same stereotyped references, with
slight variations in supposition and inference.
This fact led to the query, “Is there no new data?
Have excavators and translators of other literatures
discovered no evidence of this usage”?
About four years and a half ago, I set about the
task of reading in translation all that was available
of the mass of material furnished us through
the labors of such men as Dr. Legge, Prof. Max
Mueller, Prof. Sayce and many others of the
worthy host of oriental scholars. A few of the
most interesting are given of the items that came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
to light in the course of a somewhat extensive and
at times tedious reading.</p>

<p>In the literature of ancient China, (Li Ki, Book
III., Ch. II., Sec. 27) we find this statement: “A
tenth of the year’s expenditures was for sacrifices.”
Simcox (Primitive Civilizations, Vol. II,
p. 36) comments as follows: “This is nearly the
only recognition of a tithe for religious or quasi-religious
purposes in China and probably represents
a very ancient fragment of tradition. The
king received a tithe of the national produce, and
he may have been anciently expected to spend a
tithe of the revenue so obtained upon the rites of
public worship; but an earlier passage in that same
book describes the Son of Heaven as retaining
nine-tenths of the produce of his domains for his
own use, and employing the other tenth to defray
the charges of the public offices.”</p>

<p>Prof. Maspero (The Dawn of Civilization, p.
302) writes thus concerning the customs in earliest
Egypt: “The gods of the side which was victorious
shared with it in the triumph and received
a tithe of the spoil as the price of their help.”
Again (p. 706) in speaking of a king in relation
to the gods among the ancient Chaldeans, he says:
“As soon as he had triumphed by their command,
he sought before all else to reward them amply
for the assistance they had given. He poured a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
tithe of the spoils into the coffers of their treasury,
he made over a part of the conquered country
to their domain, he granted them a tale of the
prisoners to cultivate their lands or to work at
their buildings.”</p>

<p>Prof. Maspero is writing of the earliest civilization
which dates from 3000 to 4000 B. C.,
while Moses, it needs to be borne in mind, lived
and wrote not more than 1500 years before
Christ.</p>

<p>Prof. Hilprecht’s splendid summary (Explorations
in Bible Lands during the 19th Century, recently
published) confirms this view. In giving
account of Rassam’s discoveries in the ruins of
Abu Habba, the ancient Babylonian city of Sippara,
he says (p. 275) the tablets discovered
“make us acquainted with the duties and daily
occupations of the different classes of temple officers
and their large body of servants, with the ordinary
tithes paid by the faithful, and with many
other revenues accruing to the sanctuary from all
kinds of gifts, from the lease of real estate, slaves,
and animals, and from the sale of products from
fields and stables. As tithes were frequently paid
in kind, it became necessary to establish regular
depots along the principal canals, where scribes
stored and registered everything that came in.
Among the goods thus received we notice vegetables,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
meat, and other perishable objects which
the temple alone could not consume, and which,
therefore, had to be sold or exchanged before they
decayed or decreased in value. No wonder that
apart from its distinct religious sphere the great
temple of Shamash at Sippara in many respects
resembled one of the great business firms of Babel
or Nippur.” He further says (p. 311), in speaking
of some ancient tablets found in the ruins of
ancient Nippur by the party of which he was a
member, “they consisted of business documents
referring to the registry of tithes, and to the administration
of the temple property.” These
tablets discovered in 1888 proved to be a part of
the great Temple Library discovered by Prof.
Hilprecht in 1900. Many of them date back to
the third millennium before Christ and some bear
such names as that of the now famous author of
the code of laws, Hammurabi; and others belong
to the time as remote as that of Sargon, 3800
B. C.</p>

<p>In “Records of the Past” (edition of 1890, Vol.
III., p. 96) we read “In a field of a tenth, he takes
a tenth.” “As for the tithe, he gives one part as
tithe to the palace.” Among the various kinds
of divisions or land tenures, we find these two:
“The division of a tenth,” and “The division with
a tithe.” G. Bertin, the translator, says: “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
work, as we know it from the fragment in the
British Museum, is accompanied with a Babylonian
translation of Sargon of Agade; and the
fragments recovered are those of a Ninevite transcription
made in the time of Asshurbanipal for his
library.” The tablets are divided into two columns,
the left hand one giving the Akkadian and
the right hand one the translation. The translator
further says: “The tablet from which the
above is a translation is of great importance as
giving us information and particulars as to the
system of land tenure and cultivation of land in
the early Akkadian period.” The date of this
Sargon is now pretty well fixed at about 3800
B. C. This extensive system of land tenure being
in vogue at that date argues that it had been in
use in a less extensive form for a long time previous
to the date of this publication.</p>

<p>The Pundit Dutt (Ancient India, Vol. II., p.
38), writing on “The Rationalistic Period, B. C.
1000-242,” quotes Megasthenes of the Fourth
Century B. C., who gives an account of the civil
administration of a city during that period as saying:
“Those who have charge of the city are divided
into six bodies of five each.” In enumerating
the duties of each, he says: “The sixth and
last class consists of those who collect the tenth
of the prices of the articles sold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>Added to these references to China, India,
Egypt, and Ancient Assyria and Babylonia, is the
array of evidence commonly presented in writings
on the tithe, including testimony from the
Persians, Arabians, Phœnicians, Carthagenians
and various other African communities, the ancient
Britons, the Grecians and the Romans. One
familiar instance from the Greeks will suffice for
illustration.</p>

<p>In Xenophon’s Anabasis, book V, chapter 3,
we are told that “they divided the money raised
from the sale of captives and of the tenth which
they took out for Apollo and for the Ephesian
Artemis (Diana of the Ephesians), the generals
took each a part to keep for the gods.” Referring
to Xenophon’s own home in Scillus, we read: “He
made both an altar and a temple with the consecrated
money; and also thereafter always collecting
a tithe of the fruits of the season from the
land, he offered sacrifice to the goddess; and all
the citizens and neighboring men and women partook
of the feast.” A slab was set by the temple
having the inscription, “The sacred place of Artemis.
Let the one who has possession and enjoys
the fruit thereof (i. e., of the estate) offer the
tithe each year, and from the surplus repair the
temple. If any one does not do this, it will be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
care to the goddess,” i. e., she will punish him as
an offender.</p>

<p>We now come to the era of the Church Fathers.
Here we will quote more at length because of the
importance of this testimony to the minds of many
who are dealing with this subject. It is understood
that these witnesses are not to be regarded
as final authorities to those of us who believe in
the inspired revelation, but they are important
and interesting because they reflect the practice
of the Church when it was making its first great
effort to preach the gospel to every creature and
was making that effort, as is generally supposed,
in use of methods sanctioned by the Apostles. The
quotations, unless otherwise indicated, are from
the edition of The Ante-Nicene, Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers, published by the Christian Literature
Co. of New York.</p>

<p>Clement (30-100 A. D.), who is generally
agreed to be the one mentioned in Phil. 4:3, wrote
a letter to the Corinthians, some think in 68, but
the majority in 97 A. D. He says (Vol. I., p. 16),
“These things therefore being manifest to us, and
since we look into the depths of the divine knowledge,
it behooves us to do all things in (their
proper) order, which the Lord has commanded us
to perform at stated times. He has enjoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
offerings (to be presented) and service to be performed
(to Him), and that not thoughtlessly or
irregularly, but at the appointed times and hours.
Where and by whom He desires these things to be
done, He Himself has fixed by His own supreme
will, in order that all things being piously done
according to His good pleasure, may be acceptable
unto Him. Those, therefore, who present their
offerings at the appointed times, are accepted and
blessed; for inasmuch as they follow the laws of
the Lord, they sin not. For his own peculiar
services are assigned to the high priest, and their
own proper place is prescribed to the priests, and
their own special ministrations devolve on the
Levites. The layman is bound by the laws that
pertain to laymen.</p>

<p>“Let every one of you, brethren, give thanks to
God in his own order, living in all good conscience,
with becoming gravity, and not going beyond
the rule of the ministry prescribed to him.
Not in every place, brethren, are the daily sacrifices
offered, or the peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings
and the trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem
only. And even there they are not offered
in any place, but only at the altar before the temple,
that which is offered being first carefully examined
by the high priest and the ministers
already mentioned. Those, therefore, who do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
anything beyond what is agreeable to His will,
are punished with death. Ye see, brethren, that
the greater the knowledge that has been vouchsafed
to us, the greater also is the danger to which
we are exposed.”</p>

<p>In The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (Vol.
VII., p. 381), supposed to have been written about
120 A. D., we read: “But every true prophet
that willeth to abide among you is worthy of support.
So also a true teacher is himself worthy,
as the workman, of his support. Every first-fruit,
therefore, of the products of wine-press and
threshing-floor, of oxen and of sheep, thou shalt
take and give to the prophets, for they are your
high priests. But if ye have not a prophet, give
it to the poor. If thou makest a batch of dough,
take the first-fruit and give according to the commandment.
So also when thou openest a jar of
wine or of oil, take the first-fruit and give it to the
prophets; and of money (silver) and clothing and
every possession, take the first-fruit, as it may
seem good to thee, and give according to the commandment.”</p>

<p>Justin Martyr (110-165) furnishes the following
testimony (Vol. I., p. 167) when speaking of
the changes that have taken place in the Christians.
He says that, among other things, “we
who valued above all things the acquisition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
wealth and possessions, now bring what we have
into a common stock, and communicate to every
one in need.” In describing a church service
(186), he further says: “And they who are well-to-do,
and willing, give what each thinks fit; and
what is collected is deposited with the president,
who succours the orphans and widows, and those
who, through sickness or any other cause, are in
want, and those who are in bonds, and the
strangers sojourning among us, and in a word
takes care of all who are in need.”</p>

<p>Irenaeus (120-202) gives an exceedingly valuable
discussion of the relation between the law and
the gospel, in which (Vol. I., pp. 476, 477 and
478) he says: “As in the law, therefore, and in
the Gospel (likewise), the first and greatest commandment
is, to love the Lord God with the whole
heart, and then there follows a commandment
like to it, to love one’s neighbor as one’s self;
the author of the law and the Gospel is shown to
be one and the same. For the precepts of an absolutely
perfect life, since they are the same in each
Testament, have pointed out (to us) the same
God, who certainly has promulgated particular
laws adapted for each; but the more prominent
and the greatest (commandments), without which
salvation cannot (be attained), He has exhorted
(us to observe) the same in both.... And that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the Lord did not abrogate the natural (precepts)
of the law, by which man is justified, which also
those who were justified by faith, and who pleased
God, did observe previous to the giving of the law,
but that He extended and fulfilled them, is shown
from His words.” He then quotes examples from
the Fifth Chapter of Matthew and speaks of the
obedience of those who are freed from the bondage
of the law, and adds: “And for this reason
did the Lord, instead of that (commandment),
‘Thou shalt not commit adultery,’ forbid even
concupiscence; and instead of that which runs
thus, ‘Thou shalt not kill,’ He prohibited anger;
and instead of the law enjoining the giving of
tithes, (He told us) to share all our possessions
with the poor; and not to love our neighbors only,
but even our enemies; and not merely to be liberal
givers and bestowers, but even that we should
present a gratuitous gift to those who take away
our goods.”... “Now all these (precepts), as
I have already observed, were not (the injunctions)
of one doing away with the law, but of one
fulfilling, extending, and widening it among us;
just as if one should say, that the more extensive
operation of liberty implies that a more complete
subjection and affection towards our Liberator
had been implanted within us.” In the light of
these statements, we are to understand his words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
on pages 484 and 485. “And the class of oblations
in general has not been set aside; for there
were both oblations there (among the Jews), and
there are oblations here (among the Christians).
Sacrifices there were among the people; sacrifices
there are, too, in the church; but the species alone
has been changed, inasmuch as the offering is now
made, not by slaves, but by freemen. For the
Lord is (ever) one and the same; but the character
of a servile oblation is peculiar (to itself),
as is also that of freemen, in order that, by the
very oblations, the indication of liberty may be
set forth. For with Him there is nothing purposeless,
nor without signification, nor without design.
And for this reason they (the Jews) had
indeed the tithes of their goods consecrated to
Him, but those who have received liberty set aside
all their possessions for the Lord’s purposes, bestowing
joyfully and freely not the less valuable
portions of their property, since they have the
hope of better things (hereafter); as that poor
widow acted who cast all her living into the treasury
of God.”</p>

<p>Clement of Alexandria (153-217) writing about
200 A. D. says (Vol. II., p. 366), in discussing the
source of the Greek virtues which he traces to the
Jewish law, “Besides, the tithes of the fruits and
of the flocks taught both piety toward the Deity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and not covetously to grasp everything, but to
communicate gifts of kindness to one’s neighbors.
For it was from these, I reckon, and from the
first-fruits that the priests were maintained. We
now therefore understand that we are instructed
in piety, and in liberality, and in justice, and in
humanity by the law.”</p>

<p>Tertullian (145-220), in describing the services
of the Church, says (Vol. III., pp. 46, 47),
“Though we have our treasure-chest, it is not
made up of purchase-money, as of a religion that
has its price. On the monthly day, if he likes,
each puts in a small donation; but only if it be his
pleasure, and only if he be able: for there is no
compulsion; all is voluntary. These gifts are, as
it were, piety’s deposit fund. For they are not
taken thence and spent on feasts, and drinking-bouts,
and eating-houses, but to support and bury
poor people, to supply the wants of boys and girls
destitute of means and parents, and of old persons
confined now to the house; such, too, as have suffered
shipwreck; and if there happen to be any in
the mines, or banished to the islands, or shut up
in prisons, for nothing but their fidelity to the
cause of God’s Church, they become the nurslings
of their confession. But it is mainly the deeds of
a love so noble that lead many to put a brand upon
us. See, they say, how they love one another, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
themselves are animated by mutual hatred; how
they are ready even to die for one another, for
they themselves will sooner put to death....
One in mind and soul, we do not hesitate to share
our earthly goods with one another.” In answering
the objection to their feasts as wicked and extravagant,
he retorts, “The Salii cannot have their
feast without going into debt; you must get the
accountants to tell you what the tenths of Hercules
and the sacrificial banquets cost.”</p>

<p>Probably it will not be amiss to quote Tertullian
on what he so aptly styles “the over-fed Christian,”
in view of the many appeals for money by
catering to the stomach of the saints. On the subject
of Fasting (Vol. IV., p. 113) he says, “With
you ‘love’ shows its fervor in sauce-pans, ‘faith’
its warmth in kitchens, ‘hope’ its anchorage in
waiters.”</p>

<p>Origen (185-254) says (Vol. IV., p. 652), “Celsus
would also have us to offer first-fruits to
demons. But we would offer them to Him who
said, ‘let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit
after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the
earth.’ And to Him to whom we offer first-fruits
we also send up our prayers.” He is also quoted
in Smith and Cheetham’s Dictionary of Christian
Antiquities as saying (Hom. XI., in Numeros),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
“How then is our righteousness abounding more
than that of the Scribes and Pharisees, if they
dare not taste the fruits of their land before they
offer first-fruits to the priests, and tithes are separated
for the Levites; whilst I, doing none of
these things, so misuse the fruits of the earth that
the priest knows nothing of them, the Levite is
ignorant of them, the divine altar does not perceive
them”?</p>

<p>Cyprian (200-258) in his treatise “On the Unity
of the Church” (Vol. V., p. 429) states the condition
of the Church in his time as follows: “But
in us unanimity is diminished in proportion as
liberality of working is decayed. Then they used
to give for sale houses and estates; and that they
might lay up for themselves treasures in heaven,
presented to the apostles the price of them, to be
distributed for the use of the poor. But now we
do not even give the tenths from our patrimony;
and while our Lord bids us sell, we rather buy and
increase our store. Thus has the vigor of faith
dwindled away among us; thus has the strength
of believers grown weak.”</p>

<p>The Apostolic Constitutions, connected in a
literary way with The Teaching of the Twelve
Apostles, belong, at least so far as the first six
books are concerned, to the third century. Dr.
Riddle says: “The first six books are the oldest;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
the seventh, in its present form, somewhat later,
but, from its connection with the teaching, proven
to contain matter of a very ancient date. The
eighth book is of latest date. It now seems to be
generally admitted that the entire work is not
later than the fourth century, although the usual
allowance must be made for textual changes,
whether by accident or design.”</p>

<p>Chapter 25 of book II. (Vol. VII., page 408)
has the heading, “Of First-fruits and Tithes, and
after what manner the Bishop is himself to partake
of them, or to distribute them to others.”
The following sentences are culled out of this
chapter: “Let him use those tenths and first-fruits,
which are given according to the command of
God, as a man of God; as also let him dispense in
a right manner the free-will offerings which are
brought in on account of the poor, to the orphans,
the widows, the afflicted, and strangers in distress,
as having that God for the examiner of his accounts
who has committed the disposition to him....
The Levites, who attended upon the
tabernacle, partook of those things that were
offered to God by all the people.... You,
therefore, O bishops, are to your people priests
and Levites, ministering to the holy tabernacle,
the holy Catholic Church.... As, therefore,
you bear the weight, so have you a right to partake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of the fruits before others, and to impart to
those who are in want.... For those who
attend upon the Church ought to be maintained by
the Church, as being priests, Levites, presidents,
and ministers of God.”</p>

<p>Again in Chapter 35 (page 413) we read,
“Now you ought to know, that although the Lord
has delivered you from the additional bonds, and
has brought you out of them to your refreshment,
and does not permit you to sacrifice irrational
creatures for sin-offerings, and purifications, and
scape-goats, and continual washings and sprinklings,
yet has He nowhere freed you from those
oblations which you owe to the priests, nor from
doing good to the poor.” Other references will
be found also on pages 471, 494, and among the
Canons, page 500.</p>

<p>Jerome (345-420) writes in his letter to Nepotian
(Vol. VI., Second Series) as follows: “I, if
I am the portion of the Lord, and the line of His
heritage, receive no portion among the remaining
tribes; but, like the priest and the Levite, I live on
the tithe, and serving the altar, am supported by
its offerings. Having food and raiment, I shall
be content with these, and as a disciple of the
Cross shall share its poverty.”</p>

<p>Smith and Cheetham’s Dictionary quotes
Jerome as saying on Mal. 3:10, “What we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
said of tithes and first-fruits which of old used to
be given by the people to the priests and Levites,
understand also in the case of the people of the
Church, to whom it has been commanded to sell
all they have and give to the poor and follow the
Lord and Savior.... If we are unwilling
to do this, at least let us imitate the rudimentary
teaching of the Jews so as to give a part of the
whole to the poor and pay the priests and Levites
due honor. If any one shall not do this he is
convicted of defrauding and cheating God.”</p>

<p>The same authority quotes Ambrose (340-397)
as saying (Sermon 34), “God has reserved the
tenth part to Himself, and therefore it is not lawful
for a man to retain what God has reserved for
Himself. To thee He has given nine parts, for
Himself He has reserved the tenth part, and if
thou shalt not give to God the tenth part, God
will take from thee the nine parts.” Again in a
sermon on Ascension Day, “A good Christian
pays tithes yearly to be given to the poor.”</p>

<p>From the same authority also, we get this from
Augustine (354-430) who is quoted as saying
(Hom. 48), “Our ancestors used to abound in
wealth of every kind for this very reason that they
used to give tithes, and pay the tax to Caesar.
Now, on the contrary, because devotion to God
has ceased, the drain of the treasury has increased.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
We have been unwilling to share the tithes with
God, now the whole is taken away.”</p>

<p>We quote further from Augustine (Vol. VI.,
First Series, page 367). “Let us give a certain
portion of it. What portion? A tenth? The
Scribes and Pharisees give tithes for whom Christ
had not yet shed His blood. The Scribes and
Pharisees give tithes; lest haply thou shouldst
think thou art doing any great thing in breaking
thy bread to the poor, and this is scarcely
a thousandth part of thy means. And yet I am
not finding fault with this; do even this. So
hungry and thirsty am I, that I am glad even of
these crumbs. But yet I cannot keep back what
He who died for us said whilst He was alive,
‘Except your righteousness shall exceed the
righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye
shall in no case enter into the kingdom of
heaven.’ The Scribes and Pharisees gave the
tenth. How is it with you? Ask yourselves.
Consider what you spend on mercy, what you reserve
for luxury.”</p>

<p>In commenting on Christ’s saying in Luke
11:41, “Give alms, and behold all things are clean
unto you,” Augustine says (pages 435 and 436),
“When He had spoken thus, doubtless they
thought that they did give alms. And how did
they give them? They tithed all they had, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
took away a tenth of all their produce, and gave
it. It is no easy matter to find a Christian who
doth as much.”... Christ saith to them, “I
know that ye do this, ‘ye tithe mint and anise,
cummin and rue,’ but I am speaking of other
alms: ye despise ‘judgment and charity.’”...
What is “in judgment”? Look back, and discover
thyself; mislike thyself, pronounce judgment
against thyself. And what is charity? “Love the
Lord God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind; love thy neighbor as thyself:
and thou hast done alms first to thine own
soul, within thy conscience. Whereas if thou
neglect this alms, give what thou wilt; reserve
of thy goods not a tenth, but a half; give nine
parts, and leave but one for thine own self: thou
doest nothing, when thou dost not alms to thine
own soul and art poor in thyself.”</p>

<p>Once more we find Augustine saying (Vol.
VIII., page 668), “Cut off some part of thy income;
a tenth, if thou choosest, though that is
but little. For it is said that the Pharisees gave
a tenth.... He whose righteousness thou
oughtest to exceed giveth a tenth: thou givest not
even a thousandth. How wilt thou surpass him
whom thou matchest not.”</p>

<p>Chrysostom (347-407) preaches in much the
same strain (Vol. XIII., page 69). “They gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
tithes, and tithes again upon tithes for orphans,
widows and strangers; whereas some one was
saying to me in astonishment at another, ‘Why,
such a one gives tithes.’ What a load of disgrace
does this expression imply, since what was not a
matter of wonder with the Jews has come to be
so in the case of the Christians? If there was
danger then in omitting tithes, think how great
it must be now.”</p>

<p>In preaching on Matt. 5:20, he says (Vol. X.,
pages 395, 396), “So that, though thou give alms,
but not more than they, thou shalt not enter in.
And how much did they bestow in alms? one may
ask. For this very thing, I am minded to say now,
that they who do not give may be roused to give,
and they that give may not pride themselves, but
may make increase of their gifts. What then did
they give? A tenth of all their possessions, and
again another tenth, and after this a third, so that
they almost gave away the third part, for three-tenths
put together make up this. And together
with these, first-fruits, and first born, and other
things besides, as, for instance, the offerings for
sins, those for purification, those at feasts, those
in the jubilee, those by the cancelling of debts,
and the dismissal of servants, and the lendings
that were clear of usury. But if he who gave the
third part of his goods, or rather the half (for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
those being put together with these are the half),
if he who is giving the half, achieves no great
thing, he who doth not bestow so much as the
tenth, of what shall he be worthy? With reason
He said, ‘There are few that be saved.’...
For nothing else do I hear you saying everywhere,
but such words as these: ‘Such a one has
bought so many acres of land; such a one is rich,
he is building.’ Why dost thou stare, O man, at
what is without? Why dost thou look to others?
If thou art minded to look to others, look to them
that do their duty, to them that approve themselves,
to them that carefully fulfill the law, not
to those that have become offenders and are in
dishonor.”</p>

<p>Cassian (died about 432) in the First Conference
of Abbott Thomas (Vol. XI., Second
Series, p. 503, Ch. I.), makes record of the
fact that certain young men, led by Thomas, were
“eager to offer tithes and first-fruits of their substance”
to Abbott John. This is said to be the first
instance on record of payment of tithes to a monastery.
In Ch. II. Abbott John thanks them for
these gifts and refers to Prov. 3:9, 10 as promising
a blessing for so doing. In chapters following,
he speaks of tithes and other offerings as
given by the Lord’s commands and then instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the cases of Abraham, David, and other saints
who went beyond the requirements of law. He
argues that we who are under the gospel should
sell all and give to the poor. “If even those who,
faithfully offering tithes of their fruits, are obedient
to the more ancient precepts of the Lord, cannot
yet climb the heights of the gospel, you can
see very clearly how far short of it those fall who
do not even do this.” While he holds that the law
is no longer exacted, he makes this significant
comment (p. 515). “But when the multitude of
believers began day by day to decline from that
apostolic fervor, and to look after their own
wealth, and not to portion it out for the good of
all the faithful in accordance with the arrangement
of the Apostles, but having an eye to their
own private expenses, tried not only to keep it,
but actually to increase it, not content with following
the example of Ananias and Sapphira, then
it seemed good to all the priests that men who
were hampered by world care, and almost ignorant,
if I may say so, of abstinence and contrition,
should be recalled to the pious duty by a fast canonically
enjoined, and be constrained by the necessity
of paying legal tithes, as this certainly would
be good for the weak brethren and could not do
any harm to the perfect who were living under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
the grace of the gospel and by their voluntary
devotion going beyond the law.” See also this
same thought enlarged upon in Ch. 33.</p>

<p>Four bishops who were members of the Second
Synod of Tours (567) issued a letter to the laity
in which they assert that the tithe should be paid.
(Hefele, Vol. I., p. 394). The Second Synod
of Macon (585) enjoined afresh the law of the
tithe under penalty of excommunication for refusal
to observe it. This is the first official enactment
that is considered authentic by those who
are said to be authorities. From that time on its
endorsement and enforcement became common
and at length almost universal in the Church.
The first Christian emperors assigned land and
other property to ministers for their support, but
enacted no law respecting the tithe. The first
legal enactment was made by Charlemagne, king
of the Franks, 768-800, and Roman emperor,
800-814. His Capitularies established its practice
in the Roman empire, and thence it spread to
other lands. Offa, king of Mercia, introduced the
tithe system into England about the close of the
eighth century, and Ethelwulf in the ninth
century, or according to Clarke (History of
Tithes), Athelstan 927, made it a law for the
whole English realm. To what the tithe was to be
devoted was optional until Innocent III., through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
the Archbishop of Canterbury, 1200, issued a decretal
requiring tithes to be paid to the clergy of
the parish to which the payee belonged, which
decree Clarke says was inoperative until reissued
by the General Council of Lateran, 1215, when
the parson was finally given the parochial right
to the tithes. The tithe was introduced into Portugal
and Denmark in the eleventh century, into
Sweden in the thirteenth, and soon became a general
law of Christendom.</p>

<p>The Roman secular law provided that any one
who obtained a part of the public land in a conquered
country should pay to the state a tenth of
the revenue he derived from its rent, and this
system was usually transferred to the colonies
settled on the soil. When the church tithe came
into prominence there arose two kinds, secular
and ecclesiastical tithes, which to a greater or
less extent have been associated and commingled
in almost every civilization from the earliest
times. It would be impossible, were it deemed
necessary, to state in a brief limit the minutiæ of
this complicated tithe system. It was not abolished
by the Reformation. Luther and Calvin believed
in tithing for the support of the Church. It may
be worth while to quote from the First Book of
Discipline, which Knox heartily approved. One
section runs as follows: “The sums able to sustain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the forenamed persons, and to furnish all things
appertaining to the preservation of good order
and policy within the Kirk, must be lifted of
tenths, the tenth sheaf of all sorts of corn, hay,
hemp and lint: tenth fish, tenth calf, tenth lamb,
tenth wool, tenth foal, tenth cheese. And because
that we know that the tenth reasonably taken, as
is before expressed, will not suffice to discharge
the former necessity” it directs other gifts and
rents. These Reformers, however, felt the burden
of the enforced tithe and the movement grew
apace to remove it. It was abolished in France in
1789. Other countries where any law obtains,
have largely commuted it to a fixed annual sum of
money, after the system in vogue in England to-day.
Enlightened Christendom is rightfully rebelling
against this enforced tribute and is looking
for a more spontaneous support.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LINES OF ARGUMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p>There are certain conclusions, it seems to me,
which may safely be drawn from this brief summary
of the evidence now before us. First: <span class="smcap">The
Tithe is a Universal Principle, not a Levitical
Institution</span>.</p>

<p>It seems peculiar to one who has studied the
subject in the light of the new data which is now
being brought to light so abundantly, that one
should be so regularly confronted with the assertion
that the tithe is a Levitical institution. It is
stranger still that so many ministers continue to
assert this as a fact, when the unanimous testimony
of such men as Prof. Sayce, Prof. Maspero,
Dr. Hilprecht and others of their standing can
easily be gathered to the contrary. They all assert
that no matter how old the civilization there
is always abundant evidence of proportionate giving
to the gods and almost invariably the tenth.
The only apparent exception is in the Laws of
Manu of Ancient India, wherein we find one-tenth,
one-eighth, and one-sixth specified as the
tribute to the king who doubtless saw to it that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
one-sixth became general in India. It is likely
that if we had the most ancient laws we would
find that the one-tenth prevailed, even in India.</p>

<p>Just as I had reached this stage in writing, there
came to my notice a communication from Rev.
Henry Lansdell, D. D., London, England, calling
attention to his investigations in the same line,
which abundantly confirm the statements made.
He gives two personal incidents which I deem
worthy of record here. “The Rev. J. E. Padfield,
a missionary of my acquaintance, whose station at
Musulipatam I visited in 1890, took the pains
to inquire systematically and in detail over his
large district, of every native Christian family in
each congregation, as to how much heathen in
their own social position would pay, or what
would have been the amount of their own religious
offerings had they continued to be heathens.
This was done with a view to comparison
with what they gave for Christian religious purposes
of every kind. As a result of that inquiry
it was stated that the high caste Brahmins had
been wont to spend for religious purposes the
equivalent of a month’s income per annum; the
lower castes, such as farmers, cultivators, and
coolies spending less: but speaking of these particular
Christians as a whole it appeared that
whilst they were heathen they had to expend upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
religious observances not less than one-thirteenth
of their net incomes.”</p>

<p>Once more: when prosecuting my studies one
day at the British Museum, I was accosted by a
well-educated young Sikh, who came from Amritsar,
and was brother, or near relative, of the chief
priest of the Golden Temple, which I remember
to have visited. Upon my asking for any information
he could give relative to the subject I was
studying, he said that, in the time of Baba Aryan
Sodhi, the fifth Sikh Guru (or teacher), the people
gave a tenth part of their incomes for religious
purposes; but that in the present day, good
Sikhs give about one-twentieth, though the proportion
varies. These examples confirm what
I have learned from missionaries as to the present
status of the subject in India, and largely also in
many other countries. The latter instance tends
to prove that at times in the earlier history of
India the tithe has prevailed, which is the point
with which we are at present concerned.</p>

<p>Seeing that the tithe has been so universal, it
may be of interest to inquire why it should have
been so universal. It matters little whether you
take the portion offered to the gods or the tribute
to the kings as the Sons of Heaven and representatives
of the gods, why should we find in all
these ancient civilizations one-tenth as the universal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
offering? Why should not all have had
one-sixth as in India at one time? It surely cannot
be ascribed to the inherent generosity of the
priests and rulers. Seven is also a sacred number.
Why did they not require one-seventh?</p>

<p>The tithe finds an interesting parallel in sacrifice
with which it is closely connected. For when
one is commanded to sacrifice, the minimum at
least must be set to his sacrifice. Sacrifice, I believe,
was a divine institution given to our first
parents in Eden. Most likely the tithe is seen, in
germ at least, in the offerings of Cain and Abel.
The Council of Seville viewed Cain’s sin as one
of covetousness in withholding a portion of the
tithe or part that God required. The Septuagint
reading of Gen. 4:7, which the early Church
Fathers seem invariably to adopt, and a literal
translation of Heb. 11:4 point to this view. Personally
I like to translate the latter “more of a
sacrifice” which is simple and includes both the
idea of quantity and that of quality and spirit.
Wickliffe translated it “a much more sacrifice.”
Westcott maintains that this is correct. The
critical scholars generally admit that such is the
natural rendering, but claim not to be able to see
why such a thing should be said. Covetousness
played so prominent a part in the parent’s fall,
why should it not in the son’s sin, seeing that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
is one of the most persistent of the Satan brood?
Dr. John Brown, in his Commentary on Hebrews,
Vol. II., page 41, quotes another who says:
“It is easy to be demonstrated that sacrifices owe
their original to the will and appointment of God.
The Apostle says, as Moses said before him, that
Abel’s sacrifice was acceptable to God. But it
would not have been acceptable if it had not been
of divine institution, according to that plain, obvious
and eternal maxim of all true religion,
Christian, Mosaic, and natural, ‘In vain do they
worship God, teaching for doctrines the commandments
of men,’ Mark 7:7. If there be any
truth in this maxim, Abel would have worshipped
God in vain, and God would have had no respect
to his offering, if his sacrifice had been merely a
commandment of his father Adam, or an invention
of his own. The divine acceptance, therefore,
is a demonstration of a divine institution.”</p>

<p>This line of argument is almost unanimously
accepted among Christian scholars as an adequate
basis for the belief that sacrifice was a divine institution.
Why is it not fully as applicable to tithing?
It is not stated in Scripture, prior to the
giving of the Mosaic law, that either is a divine
institution. But if “divine acceptance is a demonstration
of a divine institution,” the tithe has as
clear a demonstration of its origin as has sacrifice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Now and then in Scripture the whole business of
sacrifice is spoken of in a deprecating way. Cf.
Heb. 10. Such is not the case in respect to the
tithe, unless Amos 4:4 be so taken.</p>

<p>But whatever view one may take of the origin
of the tithe, there can be no reason for the claim
that it is a Jewish institution. It is true that there
are some people who seem to think that Adam
was the first Jew and that everything from Adam
to Christ was Jewish. In the very region whence
came Abraham, the first Jew, the tithe was in
force as early as 3800 B. C., which is nearly 2000
years before there was a Jew. It was as well defined
in Babylonia at that period as it was in
Judea in the time of Moses and would much better
be called Babylonian than Jewish.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, we may reiterate the words of
Dr. Kennicott. “Whatever custom has prevailed
over the world, among nations the most opposite
in polity and customs in general, nations not
united by commerce or communication (when that
custom has nothing in nature or the reason of
things to give it birth, and establish to itself such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
a currency), must be derived from some revelation,
which revelation may in certain places have
been forgotten, though the custom introduced by
and founded on such a revelation still continued;
and further, this revelation must have been antecedent
to the dispersion at Babel, when all mankind,
being but one nation and living together in
the form of one large family, were of one language
and governed by the same laws and customs.”
With sacrifice, the tithe went abroad
over the face of the whole earth and survived long
after its origin was forgotten. If “in the annals
of all times none are found which did not pay
tithes” among the nations of the past, either as
an offering to the gods or as a tribute to the
rulers, the evidence certainly warrants the conclusion
that “offerings of at least one-tenth to
God, was a primeval appointment not for the
Jews, but for all nations.”</p>

<p>Second: <span class="smcap">Although Universal it Was Incorporated
Into and Made the Basis of the
Mosaic System of Tithes.</span></p>

<p>In the Mosaic system there was a general tithe,
conforming in every feature to this universal
tithe. Then there was a second tithe, of national
significance only, used as material for a feast at
a designated place the first and second year. But
the third year it was to be eaten at home, the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
sharing in the feast. This is the best view, I
think, of what some call the third tithe. Hence
every Jew offered two-tenths each year besides
the first-fruits and all other offerings free-will
and required. Counting the first-fruits at from
one-thirtieth to one-sixtieth (as rabbis tell us
they were estimated) the Jew must needs give
about twenty-five per cent of all his yearly income.
Chrysostom figures it at a third to a half,
but the probability is that he has it too high.
Those of us who speak on the tithe are often
accused of trying to put the Church back on the
Jewish basis, which is another of those foolish
things that even some fairly intelligent people
seem to never tire of saying, no matter how little
sense there is in them. To reach a Jewish basis,
the average Christian would have to give at least
ten times what he is now giving, not merely one-tenth
of his income. Let us get up to the heathen
standard, before we worry too much about being
Judaized.</p>

<p>Third: <span class="smcap">Being Universal the Principle of
the Tithe is not to be Counted as Abrogated
When the Old Testament Economy Ended,
Unless it be so Stated or at Least by Fair
Inference be Implied.</span></p>

<p>It certainly is not stated anywhere in the New
Testament that the tenth is no longer the Lord’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Neither can any fair inference be drawn showing
that it is no longer holy to the Lord. The two
incidents cited, it is true, contain rebukes to the
Pharisees who were tithers, but the tithing is not
condemned any more than is prayer or fasting.
It is the manner, not the principle, that is condemned.
On the contrary, tithing is emphatically
commended. For the Savior says, “These ought
ye to have done and not to have left the other
undone.” I am well aware that it is the reply of
many that Christ merely commended their doing
what was a plain duty under the Mosaic law, but
that he in no way implies that such a duty was
binding on others. Granting that the first statement
is an assumption, then we have it answered
by another assumption, with the result that the
whole statement of Christ is of no weight in the
matter. Christ did not always fall in with the
teachings of the Mosaic system, as for example
in the matter of granting divorce. If He had
wanted to do away with the tithe, certainly He
could have said so, as clearly as He did in matters
of divorce. He does not here, or elsewhere, offer
any substitute for this universal standard, and He
spoke often on the subject of money and of covetousness.
One verse in every four in the gospels by
Matthew, Mark, and Luke have to do with these
subjects, and one verse in every six in the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
New Testament. Certainly if a new standard
were to be revealed, there is abundance of opportunity.</p>

<p>The objection may be stated here that sacrifice
was likewise universal. True enough, but we
have fulfillment of all its obligations and typical
significance in the perfect sacrifice, “The Lamb of
God which taketh away the sin of the world,”
“Our High Priest who needeth not daily like
those high priests who offer up sacrifices, first for
his own sin and then for the sins of the people.
For this he did once for all when he offered up
himself.”</p>

<p>I have also met this objection. Circumcision
and polygamy were universal, and your argument
would establish them. In the first place circumcision
was never universal, and even if it had
been, we have numerous statements in the New
Testament denying its further claim and a seal
of the covenant, as I believe, clearly revealed
which was to supersede it. As to polygamy, it
may be safely affirmed that it never was divinely
commanded, it is contrary to a definite law of
God, announced to our first parents, and reaffirmed
in the New Testament.</p>

<p>With sacrifice all the rites of ceremonial significance
and the retinue of priests and Levites
which administered them came to an end. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
moral obligations, however, were not abolished,
but many of them were more strictly interpreted.
The Sermon on the Mount reveals a higher conception
of moral obligation and requires a purer
motive than any precept of the Old Testament.
The laws of home relationship are made more
binding. The bill of divorcement is swept away
and only the great principle recognized, namely,
faithlessness to the universal law, “Thou shalt not
commit adultery.” Even in the case of ritual
offering this is true. Take an example. While
incense is abolished, that which is symbolized,
the great heart beat of humanity which we call
prayer, is not abolished but is enlarged to a precept
of exceeding broad scope, “Pray without
ceasing.”</p>

<p>Now we demand some word of fair implication
at least, or some example to show that the universal
obligation of the tithe has been set aside in
the general shaking up of the earth. It was not
removed as being one of “the things that are
made,” but, as I believe, it remains as one of “the
things which cannot be shaken.” This statement
is borne out by the evidence afforded from its
history. “These thing ought ye to have done”
is a word that justifies our conclusion.</p>

<p>Fourth: <span class="smcap">Not Being Abrogated When the
Old Testament Economy Ended, it is Universally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Binding in the New Testament
Dispensation.</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been written to the
contrary, I am firmly persuaded that this was
recognized by the early Church. The quotations
cited are abundantly sufficient to prove this statement,
if fairly interpreted. And this leads me to
enter a protest against the unfair presentation
of this evidence on the part of many writers. This
can be illustrated by the case of Irenaeus who is
invariably, so far as I have seen, set down as on
the side of the abrogation of the law of the tithe,
because he said in one place as quoted on page 17
“instead of the law enjoining the giving of tithes,
(He told us) to share all our possessions with the
poor.” Certainly nothing could be found, nor is
found, more explicit than that statement. Yet
any one who reads the whole context will see that
Irenaeus is contending for just the opposite thing.
He classes the tithe, not with the ceremonial
things, but with the natural precepts, by which
he means the moral law as is clearly shown. To
argue that Irenaeus is abrogating the tithe, is to
argue that he is doing away with the law of
adultery and murder, for he mentions them in
exactly the same language. The same thing
would be true of the commandment to love our
neighbors. But why should we debate this point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
when Irenaeus distinctly says, “all these precepts,
as I have already observed, were not (the injunctions)
of one doing away with the law, but of one
fulfilling, extending, and widening it among us.”</p>

<p>Now I should like to know how it comes that
all these learned men who speak so surely of
Irenaeus have always neglected to quote Irenaeus
as to what he really meant? Personally, I am
willing to stake the whole case on Irenaeus. For
I do not know a better presentation of the whole
question than he makes. When he includes tithing
under the head of the moral precepts of the
law and then says emphatically “that the Lord
did not abrogate the natural (precepts) of the
law,” I am sure that he stated the whole truth
in respect to this subject. That he enlarged their
scope and raised the maximum of moral requirement,
he rightly affirms. When that is understood
there is no more room for debate.</p>

<p>But why such dreadful alarm over this tithe
law? Why, for example, should the writer in
Smith and Cheetham’s Dictionary try to minimize
all this testimony of the Father’s? He is anxious
to prove that “the evidence belonging to this
period would seem to show that payment of tithe
was first regarded as a duty soon after A. D.
350. By that time the idea generally prevailed
that the priest of the Christian Church had succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
to the office of the Levitical priests, and
consequently to their rights and privileges.” His
bogy comes to light in the following: “Cyprian
(Epist. 1:9, Ed. Erasmus, 66 Pamel.) writes to
dissuade a presbyter from accepting the position
of guardian on the ground that the clergy are
separated from all secular business. The tribe of
Levi had no inheritance but was supported by
tithes, that they might devote themselves entirely
to divine service; ‘the same plan and form
is now preserved in regard to the clergy’ that they
may not be diverted from their sacred duties,
but ‘receiving as it were tithes may not depart
from the altar.’ Here the phrase tanquam decimas
is decisive against the payment of tithe as
a fixed legal due, for decimae paid as legal dues
could not be tanquam decimae. There is analogy,
not identity in the method of support.” The word
“legal” is the key to all this twisting and trembling.
This will be explained, perhaps, when we
recall that he is an Englishman, and comes of a
race that has suffered much from enforced tithing.
Uhlhorn’s Christian Charity in the Ancient
Church is marred by the same tremendous
anxiety to kill off any hope of this legal monster
ever getting loose again. Hence it seems that it
is now time to say that the tithe never was in
Bible times, the legal monster that it afterward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
became. Under Old Testament teaching and
practice, the tithe was voluntary. No hand of
force was used to collect it, but as in the time of
Hezekiah, the people brought in the tithes willingly
and abundantly. It was a moral precept, enforced
by appeals to the conscience. Hezekiah
does not reckon on the tithes in a way that indicates
that he would compel them to be brought in,
but expresses his gratitude when he finds that so
much was brought in by the people. The appeal
of Malachi to the nation that had robbed God is
a moral appeal and is based upon the same
thought that we find in all such appeals of Scripture.
That the Pharisees by their traditions
had reduced it to a burdensome legal requirement
need not be questioned. So did they weigh down
every moral precept that the Lord ever laid upon
the conscience of men. The advocacy of the tithe
in this country is always on the voluntary basis,
so far as I know. I feel that it would be a
calamity were it put on any other basis, and I
know that all who are working in this line, so far
as I have become acquainted with their work,
have the same feeling. What we believe is that
this is God’s standard of giving, a minimum below
which one cannot fall and be entitled to a
claim on God’s rich promises of blessing to those
who give money for His work. The maximum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
claim is the one of which the Fathers so often
speak. Matt. 19:21. “Sell that thou hast, and
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
heaven.” Between these two claims love finds
its field of operation and its measure of perfectness.
This is our view and the view which I
think prevailed in the early Church.</p>

<p>Clement’s Letter to the Corinthians, the nearest
writing to the inspired books of the New Testament,
says: “Those who present their offerings at
the appointed times are blessed; for inasmuch as
they follow the laws of the Lord they sin not.”
(See page 14.) The context clearly shows that he
has in mind the laws governing the offerings to
the priests and Levites. The Teaching speaks of
“giving according to the commandment,” which
must mean the Levitical commandment, or one
similar to it. Justin Martyr first says that they
put what they “have into a common stock” and
later says “they who are well-to-do and willing,
give what each thinks fit,” and in both cases
seems to intimate that what is contributed is
given to the dependent. (See page 16.) His
last instance of giving as each one thinks fit, may
be a description applicable to those who sought
to follow the law of the free-will offering which
is laid down in Deut. 16:10, 17, and reaffirmed
by the Apostle in I Cor. 16:2. A special contribution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
to the poor would be made now on the
same basis in any of our churches and does not
touch the subject of the regular support of the
Church. Yet many ministers who ought to know
better, insist on saying that this is the New Testament
law of giving. It is most decidedly not a
New Testament, but an Old Testament law, confirmed
by the New Testament, and by common
sense apart from any question of Scripture authority.</p>

<p>If Justin meant to affirm that this regulation
was in force, well and good. But if he meant to
say, as some would have us believe, that the
Church had thus early gotten on the basis of
every man doing exactly as he pleased, then all
we have to say is that from our modern experience
with that sort of teaching, we cannot commend
his judgment or the practice of the Church
of which he was a part, for no such principle,
ever had, or ever can have, the sanction of God.
Again how this can be reconciled with the statement
that they have put all into the common stock
is more than I can see. How could men be well-to-do
who had sold all and put it into the hands
of others? It may be for convenience of his argument
that he describes in the first case what
some few have done, perhaps himself among the
number, and that in the Church service, he is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
telling of either the observance of the rule of the
free-will offering, or else is letting us into a
state of anarchy respecting the proper teaching
on the subject of giving, which led to the difficulties
of the later centuries. The same comment
may be made on the statements of Tertullian.
It will be noted that he does not tell how
the aggressive work of the Church is to be supported,
but only of what is secured for what we
commonly call charitable purposes.</p>

<p>It may be that the reason we begin to hear of
shortcomings in giving as early as in the time
of Origen and Cyprian, is that this every-man-do-as-he-thinks-fit
teaching is bearing its legitimate
fruit and that now there must be some
heroic measures taken to offset its fatal influence.
From what these witnesses tell us, the Church of
the third century was reaping the fruit of some
erroneous teaching and practice in respect to the
giving of money. From that time on the call is
to a recognition of duty, as all the extracts go to
show. The gift of the maximum had been made
by the few. The many had followed their own
will and the result was disastrous to the Church,
and we are not surprised that the later writings
abound in appeals to the people to meet even the
minimum demands of the tithe, if they ever expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to exceed the righteousness of the Scribes
and Pharisees.</p>

<p>But it is to be noted that only Justin Martyr
and Tertullian seem to endorse a hit and miss
plan of giving. With these exceptions, the Fathers
agree that the laborers in the kingdom of
Christ take the place of the ministers of the
Mosaic period, and deserve to be as well supported,
according to the teaching of Christ in
Matt. 10:10 and Luke 10:7, enforced by that of
Paul in I Cor. 9:7-11 and I Tim. 5:18. And here
it may be said in passing, that Paul justifies his
plea for support in the work of the Gospel by—“Saith
not the law the same also?” If the law
confirms the justice of the laborer’s claim under
the Gospel, is it such a perversion of the spirit of
the Gospel to urge that one do not fall short of
a plain requirement of that same law? This
identification of the teachers of both dispensations
and of the method of their support is not a later
growth, as the Smith and Cheetham’s writer
would have us believe, but is found in the very
earliest writings. It is quite likely that different
practices prevailed at different times and in different
places in the Church. But it is to be borne
in mind that with the two exceptions named, the
testimony is for meeting God’s requirement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
whether it be that the requirement was considered
to be the whole or the tithe, and that there
is no approval given to the do-as-you-please plan
in matters of conduct.</p>

<p>Here I think it in place to repeat some things
said in Tithe Conferences at Winona and elsewhere
during the past year in regard to one of
the most persistent and misguided of all the objections
with which we are confronted. It is
urged that the New Testament bases all action
on love and that one must give according to his
love and that this is the only Christian standard
of life and service. This is confusion much confounded.
It is a fixed principle of ethics that men
cannot be a law to themselves and civilization be
preserved and conduct properly regulated.
Though good men may fail to see it, this method
of giving according to the measure of one’s love
is, at the bottom, anarchy pure and simple. Every
man is left to determine what he shall do according
to the impulse of the moment and without any
regard to a fixed standard of right. Such a principle
cannot be tolerated in social life. There is
a standard of law which makes the right for one
the right for all and to set this aside in any case
is to invite trouble. In all human conduct, a
fixed standard, apart from men, must be the basis
of right. It must be invariable and must obtain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
in one life as much as in another. Hence this
high-sounding plea for love as the basis of all
action is pure anarchy in Christian guise. Lawless
grace is as loveless as lawless humanity.
License claimed on account of standing under
grace, though put on a heavenly plane, is hell-born
just the same. License means anarchy, and
anarchy is devilish though concerned with the
holiest of occupations. To make love a standard
of action is to confuse a motive and a standard.
Love is variable, not the same in any two individuals,
and not the same in any individual at
different times.</p>

<p>Has love no place in God’s scheme? Certainly
it has, and a very large place at that. God’s plan
does not limit love in its maximum which is all
“that thou hast.” But what we contend is that
God does have a minimum standard below which
one cannot fall and claim to have the love of Christ
constraining him. Love fulfills law, doesn’t abrogate
it as so many seem to think. The law says,
Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Love
says, I will make that day and every day holy
unto the Lord, but does not say, I will do away
with the law altogether as to that which God has
made the minimum requirement of the race. Love
may go beyond the law’s requirement, but will not
fall below it. Love does not and cannot repeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
law, but obeys it and furnishes the only true motive
to obedience. Grace alters and exalts the
motive but cannot free from the obligations of
law.</p>

<p>A little clear thinking at this point would do
much to set many people right on this question
and on many other questions of Christian life.
The large amount of Pharisaical floundering and
pietistic mouthing with which the Church is persecuted
on this behalf is not creditable to our intelligence
or to our Christianity. So simple and
fundamental is this point both from the standpoint
of ethics and of religion that it seems
strange that sane men should ever call it in question.
But men were troubled with it when Paul
wrote his letter to the Romans and are still
troubled with it and strangest of all quote Paul’s
words which were written to set people straight
on this matter as the justification of the very
thing he was trying to correct. To me this is one
of the most peculiar perversions of Scripture
which has ever arisen in the history of the
Church. That the epistle to the Romans which
has for its key word righteousness (which I think
means rightness according to God’s standard and
which can have no other satisfactory meaning),
should be taken as the authority for Antinomianism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
which practically annihilates law is certainly
a singular proof of the fact that some people have
the logical faculty in a very rudimentary state. It
seems to me that we ought to be able to see that
if God’s standard of right is abrogated, then
nothing can control a man’s life but his own
promptings. What is a law but God’s standard of
right in respect to that particular line of conduct
to which it applies? What is the abrogation of
law but the doing away with God’s standard and
the substitution of a human standard? We have
become so afraid of the charge of legalism that
we have swung far to the side of anarchy, and, as
between the two, legalism is the least to be feared,
as bad as it is. Plain speech is needed for we
must not palliate the consequences of such teaching.
Paul meant well as a persecutor, but Paul
the preacher greatly deplored his course of action
in such a rôle. Men may think they are doing
God and humanity service by such advocacy, but
to me it is the devil’s work and makes for lawlessness
which is sin and which when finished
brings forth death. Lawlessness abounds in
teaching of school and Church and is it any wonder
that we stand horrified at some of its outbreaks
in our very midst? Herein I find a most
urgent call to advocate the right as God has indicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
it in respect to giving as well as to any
other of the lines of conduct which go to make
up a well-rounded life.</p>

<p>Giving is not left to the emotions of men, no
matter how pure and holy they may seem to be.
Giving is to be according to God’s measure or
requirement. To this it seems we ought all to
agree. Has God a measure? If so, what is it
and how does it operate? Some of us think that
He has and that it is fixed and invariable, the
same always and for all. Why should he not
have? Honest people of business ability do not
sell wheat by whim, potatoes for appearance sake,
or calico by hysterics. Produce is measured by
well-defined standards and disposed of in due regard
to and careful consideration of the principles
of economic distribution. Why be so careless in
respect to moral conduct? Ethical principles
ought to be, and I believe are more clearly defined
than are economic principles. What is the rule,
what the standard, are the first questions concerning
any moral act. When this is known the character
of the act is easily determined. Every grace
or fruit of the spirit is to be tested by this vital inquiry.
Faith, the first-fruit, has a unit of measure.
Belief unto salvation is the minimum of
faith. Beyond that faith may reach to heights
that seem to have no limit. But it must measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
up to that minimum, or fail to merit the name of
faith. Love the final-fruit, as we sometimes say,
has its unit, namely, the gift of self. No gift
without the giver, no love without the lover.
These minimum requirements are agreed upon by
all teachers of the gospel of redemption from sin
through the blood of Jesus Christ. No one supposes
for a moment that such teaching involves
the idea that faith and love shall never go beyond
this minimum. They must go on to perfection.</p>

<p>This brings us to answer that provoking misrepresentation
of the position of tithers which
claims that men ought to give more than the
tithe and that love to Christ should lead to the
consecration of all to Him. I do not know of
any tither who feels that the tenth is all that he
ought to give. Most pastors know that if extra
money is wanted, the tithers are not the last to
respond. Further, I have never heard such doctrine
advocated by any tither. We persistently
say that we are dealing with the minimum, not
with the maximum, not with the outgoings of
hearts full of love to Christ, but with those who
are robbing God of even His minimum and are
thus guilty of the awful crime of covetousness,
which the New Testament places among the vilest
of crimes and says that it will shut out of the
kingdom. The fifth chapter of I Corinthians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
clearly teaches that the covetous brother is to be
shut out of the fellowship of Christians, even in
this life. How does the treatment of the rich man
by many churches and communities square with
this plain teaching? The early Fathers were very
faithful in teaching concerning the crime of covetousness,
following in the footsteps of the Apostles
and of Christ Himself. How about the minister
who considers himself above the business of mentioning
money matters to the congregation? This
rank Phariseeism needs to be driven out of the
minds of ministers and theological teachers who
train ministers. If they spoke on this subject as
often as Christ did, they would need to preach on
it about once a month. Mr. Kane’s experience
wherein after three heroic efforts, he only succeeded
in finding theological professors and students
in about half the seminaries in this country
and Canada who were willing to receive literature
which he offered to furnish gratis, speaks of an
awful perversion of Scripture teaching on this
subject and a failure to grasp the vital questions
of Christian life which it touches. Is it any wonder
that there is a constant “drain of the treasury”
as Augustine said? Wrestle with it as we
may, the consecrate-all-to-the-Lord and all such
plans, have proved a dismal failure in respect to
bringing “meat” into God’s house, and the crying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
need of the hour is money to send workers into
all the world to preach the gospel. Whatever be
your scheme for getting the money, you know,
brother pastor and fellow-workers, that the great
hindrance to enlargement of the Church’s work
is money to meet necessary expenditures. Some
one always bobs up with the mystical dictum
that it is prayer, or consecration, or something
to that effect. But that is only beating the
Devil around the bush. For the promised result
of the prayer, or the consecration, or whatever
one may suggest, is that money will be forthcoming.
So after all it is money that must be
gotten, by whatsoever means one may employ.</p>

<p>The giving of all to the Lord is the only New
Testament method which is offered us as an alternative.
I am free to say that it has failed to
meet the case not only in our age, and in the age
of the Fathers who rang the changes on it, but
I am persuaded also that it did not meet the
case in the days of the Apostles. It must always
be remembered that it was voluntary, as Peter
said to Ananias, and though voluntary, it did not
fail to present difficulties very early in the history
of the Church, as the sixth chapter of Acts shows.
Again it should be remembered that the very fact
that Paul was instructed to call for a collection
for the poor saints in Jerusalem proves two things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
at least. That the needs of the Church were not
met by this voluntary communism, and that this
communism had not been adopted elsewhere to
any great extent, else the appeal to people to lay
aside for this free-will offering as God had prospered
them would have been a piece of pious nonsense.</p>

<p>The Jewish Encyclopedia (Vol. III., p. 668)
gives an interesting bit of evidence as to the effect
of this movement. We read that “against the
tendency prevailing in Essene and Christian
circles to sell all one had and ‘give to the poor’
in order to have ‘treasure in heaven’ (Matt.
19:21), the rabbis at the Synod in Usha ordained
that ‘no one should give away more than the fifth
of his fortune lest from independence he may
lapse into a state of dependence’” (Ket. 50 a).
While the evil effect of anything Christian is apt
to be overstated by these Jewish writers, still
may it not be that here we have proof that communism,
tried under the most favorable circumstances,
as it certainly was under the early
Church management, fails to meet the case, and
that Christ’s saying, “The poor always ye have
with you,” was still true and even more emphasized
under this method of social life? The fact
seems to stand out even on the pages of the book
of Acts with special emphasis that such a method,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
with the very best management, does not take
away the problem of the dependent, but really intensifies
it.</p>

<p>The Apostle Paul seems to have had to deal
with this tendency toward abuse of charity and in
doing so laid down some very fundamental propositions
to which the Church ought always to give
heed. “For even when we were with you, this
we commanded you, that if any would not work,
neither should he eat. For we hear that there are
some which walk among you disorderly, working
not at all, but are busybodies. Now them that are
such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus
Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat
their own bread.” II Thess. 3:10-12. “If any
provide not for his own, and specially for those of
his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is
worse than an infidel.” I Tim. 5:8. These positive
teachings certainly argue that Paul did not
approve of the communistic plan, for how could
one eat his own bread or provide for his own
household, if he had put all into the common
fund? In short, Paul, as the great organizer of
the Church, does not give a single hint that he
approved of such a method. All his statements
are emphatic on the other side. Even his own
custom of working for his living argues his disapproval
of the communistic idea. This should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
be borne in mind by those who are so sure that
Christian Socialism as they choose to call it, will
solve all the problems respecting the poor. Personally,
I believe that Paul’s method is the better
one and will come nearer than any other to the
solution.</p>

<p>The question is often asked, why does not the
New Testament say more about the tithe, if it is
still the universal law? The answer to this has
usually been, that all the peoples to whom the
apostles preached had been accustomed to give at
least a tenth for religious purposes and they found
no particular need to lay emphasis upon what was
a universal practice. Also that the enthusiastic
support through voluntary communism and other
large free-will offerings made it unnecessary for
them to dwell upon it. These answers have
weight and might be counted sufficient, if it were
not that they seem to assume that the New Testament
is silent on this great question. Attention
has been called to Christ’s commendation of the
tithing principle and to Paul’s appeal to the law.
But it seems to me that not enough is made of
the treatment of this subject in the one book in
which we would naturally expect it, that is, in the
book of Hebrews. The writer was trying to convince
these Hebrews of the incomparably superior
character of Christ and His priesthood to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
that to which they were so attached. We would
naturally suppose that here, if anywhere, we
would have some discussion of the tribute to this
great High Priest and that is just what we have
in the seventh chapter.</p>

<p>Rev. Henry Constable (Gold or the Gospel)
has well said, “The Levitical priesthood, by the
command of God, received tithes of their people.
It follows as certainly that Melchizedek had the
same claim to a tenth from Abraham which they
had from the Jews, i. e., a divine command. For,
surely, if a tenth were Levi’s right by divine ordinance,
while Melchizedek had no such right at all,
he is in this respect inferior to Levi, and Paul’s
argument from his reception of a tenth from
Abraham an inconclusive one.” Why, too, if
Christ does not have such a right and does not
receive the tithe is He not in that respect at least
inferior to Levi?</p>

<p>Again, we quote Dr. John Owen. “When
Abraham himself gave tithes to Melchizedek, he
did it not in his own name only, but in the name
of himself, and his whole posterity.” He argues
the significance of the act as follows. Abram
was called to be “the foundation of a new
church;” he “had now received the promise” not
only for himself, but for “all his seed in him,”
and whatever he “did in obedience unto God, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
did undertake in it for his posterity.” Wherefore
“Abraham, in this solemn address unto God
by Melchizedek the type of Christ, wherein he
expressed his covenant obedience unto him, was
the representative of all his posterity and in particular
of Levi and all the priest that descended
from him. And having now received the whole
land, by virtue of a covenant, in behalf of his posterity,
that it should be theirs, though he himself
had never possession of it nor in it, he doth in
the name of his posterity, and as their representative,
give the tenth unto God by Melchizedek, as
the chief rent which God forever reserved unto
himself, upon the grant.” This is a remarkable
argument from one who earlier in his comments
rather hesitatingly tries to break the force of the
tithe argument in general, largely, it is evident,
because of the misuse of it under the monstrous
enforced system of his day. However, if we, as
Paul contends in Galatians, are children of faithful
Abraham, and “there are not two churches,
but two states of the same church” as Dr. Owen
puts it, then either Scripture contradicts itself, or
we prove false to our covenant relationship and
dishonor Christ when we do not do homage to
Him in person, as our father Abraham did in
type in the paying of tithes. I see no escape from
this alternative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>Calvin is the only commentator, so far as I
have seen, that has given a consistent interpretation
to the 8th verse. He says, “For he thus
reasons—those to whom the Law assigns tithes
are dying men; by which it was indicated that
the priesthood would some time be abrogated, as
their life came to an end: but the Scripture makes
no mention of the death of Melchizedek, when it
relates that tithes were paid to him, so the authority
of his priesthood is limited by no time, but on
the contrary, there is given an indication of perpetuity.
But this is added for this purpose, lest a
posterior law, as it is usual, should seem to take
away from the authority of the former law. For
it might have been otherwise objected and said,
that the right which Melchizedek formerly possessed
is now void and null, because God had introduced
another law by Moses, by which He
transferred the right to the Levites. But the
Apostle anticipates this objection by saying, that
tithes were paid to the Levites only for a time,
because they did not live: but that Melchizedek,
because he is immortal, retains even to the end
what has been given to him by God.”</p>

<p>The editor, Rev. John Owen, adds this comment:
“The obvious meaning of this verse is
given by Calvin. The Levites were dying men,
which shewed the character of their office; Melchizedek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
is represented as not dying, which betokens
that his office as a priest, is perpetual.”
The tribute to the priesthood was only a temporary
right of the Levites, it will be noted Calvin
claims, and that it is the perpetual right of the
priesthood which is after the order of Melchizedek.
How clear and luminous is this interpretation
when compared with that of many who stumble
around over that verse and pretend not to be
able to see just how it fits into the Apostle’s argument.
It seems to me that we strike the most
triumphant of all the notes in this great address
to the Hebrews in this very verse. Our High
Priest has as His type one that liveth. This is
preparing the way for the “power of an endless
life” and “He ever liveth” which come later on in
the chapter. We are dealing with that which has
no end, which is true as much in respect to the
tithes paid as to any other part of this divine arrangement.
Any claim that the Levites had was
only for the time. Any claim that Christ has had
is living, is perpetual and no posterior grant can
make it null and void. Here, then, we have a
strong and inconvertible statement of the claim
that Christ has on the tithe and that at just the
point where we might be led to expect it. It seems
to me that a man must be hunting for something
when he passes this by and cries out for proof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>It may be worth while to call attention to this
fact that the oldest Babylonian reference shows
that the tithe was centuries before in force in the
near vicinity of this same Melchizedek and that
it is not any longer a question where Abraham
got his idea of a tithe.</p>

<p>Rev. Henry Constable also makes this further
point which is worth notice. The tithe is not
ceremonial as is shown by the fact that “no part”
of Jacob’s offering “was for the use of the priesthood.
The priest of Jacob’s household was
Jacob himself. When there was no ministry to
support it was yet God’s claim and accorded to
Him.”</p>

<p>It scarcely seems necessary to prolong this discussion.
The universality of the tithe, as a moral
obligation, seems to me to be beyond question. It
is the universal minimum of the race in the matter
of giving to the gods and the conclusion seems
inevitable that it is the original requirement of
God. Forms, materials, and incidents of giving
may have varied, but the standard never. There
does not appear any satisfactory reason for believing
that it does not survive the changes from
the Old to the New Dispensation. The voluntary
tithe was recognized and urged on all hands until
in the sixth century A. D. The general confusion
of Church and State and everything else that followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
gradually took away its voluntary character.
It became a sort of enforced tribute to that
monstrous duality which presided with such mock
dignity over all interests, sacred and otherwise,
until the time of reformation when divine truth
and order began once more to appear. In all the
mighty overturnings of the era of Wickliffe,
Luther, Calvin and Knox, these “stalwart old
iconoclasts” all contended for the tithe. While
they lashed unmercifully the lazy monks and
worldly clergy, yet with Wickliffe they preferred
“the good old custom of paying tithes, according
to one’s own free-will, to good and godly men,
who were able to preach the gospel.”</p>

<p>Possibly it would be well to say of Selden who
is generally quoted as opposed to the tithe, that
he himself says of his famous book, “It was not
written to prove that tithes are not due by the
Law of God.... Neither is it anything else but
itself, that is, a mere narration, and the Historie
of Tithes.” It comes out in the course of the narrative,
however, that he was contending for the
voluntary tithe, just as has been done in this discussion.
He was suffering, as many others like
him have suffered, from the oppression of human
enactment and perversion in respect to that which
God intended to be a gracious and wholesome
provision. Hence arises the odium which attaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to the word tithe. But odium is not enough
to excuse the retention of a principle represented
by a name. Like the name Christian which we
bear, it can by God’s help be made an honorable
one. It was so perverted in the time of the kings
of Israel, as God had warned them it would be.
Hezekiah, however, restored its proper usage.
The tithe was never intended for a national tax
to support the State. Its support was at first voluntary
as it seems (1 Sam. 10:27). It came to be
a fixed tribute by the demand of such kings as
Rehoboam. It is to be remembered that odium,
and perversion, and the plea of heavy taxes, did
not prevent Malachi from accusing the whole
Jewish nation of robbing God. The tithe is still
holy to Him and ought to be brought into His
house and must, if large blessings are to come.</p>

<p>The facts adduced lead inevitably to the main
conclusions reached, if I understand the principles
of logical induction. This method of induction
is quite popular at present, when applied
to certain historical data. I am persuaded that if
as much surplus ingenuity and lauded scholarship
were expended on these data as are expended on
other data to establish useless hypotheses, the
Church of God would be more edified and would
become “liberal” in a manner more pleasing to
God. Strictness in doctrine and liberality in giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
surely are more compatible with divine teaching
than liberality in doctrine and stinginess in
giving. Liberality has affected the wrong thing.
The slackening of doctrinal teaching has benefited
nothing, but has brought a flood of Rationalism,
Infidelity, and Unbelief on the Church.
Loosen the purse strings and cherish “the faith
once delivered to the saints” as God gave it, and
we have His word that the floods of evil shall be
driven back by the floods of heavenly blessings
which He challenges us to receive.</p>

<p>The sweep of the facts is broad. The conclusions
are inevitable. The tithe is universal. Its
duty remains to be performed. It seems an unnecessary
trespass on time and patience to try to
meet all the quibbles that may be started. It is
not time for sentiment, nor is it well to bring in
the poor, as if God did not know how to provide
for them. Pastors know that the poor are not the
grumblers. Many complain against the law that
the one-seventh of time is God’s. The Sabbath
is not counted a burden, neither is it annulled on
that account. Complaint settles nothing. People
complain of everything under the sun and often
of things above the sun. We are not called upon
to adjust the relations of capital and labor which
make the Sabbath and the Tithe an oppression
(if you please to call them such), in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
prove the obligation of the Sabbath and the
Tithe. One-seventh of time and one-tenth of
money belong to the Lord. Who takes either for
his own robs God, His word being witness. The
same question arises as to why both are not more
distinctly taught in the New Testament. Both
are old and well established. Each is a minimum
demanded without reservation. If this be not true
of the tithe, then there is no law governing that
grace of God in which we are to abound, unless
it be that we should hold with some of the
Fathers that “those who have received liberty
should set aside all their possessions for the
Lord’s purpose.” This is the only other method
that has the much demanded New Testament approval,
so far as amount is concerned. I do not
find even our brethren who are so strenuous for
New Testament teaching and practice, falling
over themselves to adopt this method. Our own
denomination is reckoned as a liberal one, but
counting its income according to government reports
which place the average income of every
man, woman, and child at 55 cents per day, we
have never paid for all purposes more than one-third
of one-tenth of our income into the Lord’s
treasury. Some other branches of the Church
may be a little better, but many of them are unquestionably
worse. Well might Chrysostom exclaim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
“O what a shame! that what was no great
matter among the Jews should be pretended to
be such among Christians!” Instead of giving a
tithe, we fall so far below it that the tithe actually
seems visionary to us. The most careful calculations
show very clearly that God knows how
much money he wants for His work and that with
the tithe of the Church’s income at present, the
world could be evangelized in this generation.
The early Christians gave often all their means
and all their time. We complain of one-seventh
of time and one-tenth of money. If the Jews
could give 25 per cent from the produce of Judean
hills and valleys, why cannot we give cheerfully
at least one-tenth to the kingdom of Him
who though He was rich yet for our sakes became
poor that we through His poverty might be rich?
He who falls below one-fourth gives less than the
Jew. Having a better covenant, established on
better promises, and administered by a better
Mediator, shall we grumble at one-tenth, the
tribute of a heathen or savage to a god he dreads
and with no spark of divine love to call forth his
offering? To fail to pay the tithe is not only
worse than Jewish but even worse than heathenish.
Nowhere do we find such niggardliness, no
not even in a heathen.</p>

<p>No one has ever been the worse off for doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
his duty toward God. “The Path to Wealth” by
“A Blacksmith” contains a chapter of voluntary
testimonies given at a public meeting. Twenty-nine
testimonies were given either directly or indirectly.
The occupations of the persons were
as follows: Five not named, six ministers, four
farmers, two merchants, and one each of the following:
General agent, Y. M. C. A. secretary,
student, clerk, lady stenographer, principal of
schools, shoemaker, young lady telegraph operator
who had a mother and sister to support, and
a missionary from India, who told the story of
one of his native helpers, Bhelsari Naiah, who
had been tithing for three months when this conversation
took place. “Well, Bhelsari, how does
the tithing system work?” “Capitally, sir.” “Ah,
how is that? You were always complaining of
being hard up, and even in debt, when you used
your whole income for self; now, you give one-tenth
to God, you have no complaints.” “Ah,
sir, the nine-tenths, with God’s blessing, is better
far than the ten-tenths used to be without it.”
I have received many testimonies to the same effect.
Mr. Thomas Kane, of Chicago, has had
thousands and thousands of such replies, so that
we may safely say that Bhelsari’s answer must
stand as the voice of general experience.</p>

<p>Not only have men tried it for themselves, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
it has been tried in business where firms have
kept a strict account of the Lord’s part and disbursed
it for charity and have not found the
Lord’s promise wanting. Of late years it has
come to be a prominent part in the system of
finance of various congregations. What is
known as the Tithe Covenant Plan originated in
Wesley Chapel in Cincinnati about eight years
ago. The central idea of this plan is based upon
the literal interpretation of Mal. 3:10, “Bring ye
the whole tithe into the storehouse, etc.” The
members bring in every week in an unmarked
envelope the tithe of their income for that week
and all is counted together and then distributed
by the officers of the Church according to a previously
arranged schedule. This congregation,
being a downtown one, was about to give up from
lack of support, when this plan was started and
now it is one of the most active churches in that
city and is the most liberal of any church in the
city or conference in its support of charity and
missions.</p>

<p>The Third United Presbyterian Church of Chicago
adopted this plan April 1, 1901. The Methodist
Church of Shelbyville, Ind., adopted it on
June 1, 1901. The Memorial Presbyterian Church
of Indianapolis, Ind., adopted it on July 1, 1901.
These were the churches that had made actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
trial of it, when the Tithe Conference was held at
Winona in August, 1902. Since then several have
taken it up, notably the Delaware Avenue Baptist
Church of Buffalo, N. Y., and the Eighth Presbyterian
Church of Chicago. Mr. Blynn Yates of
Buffalo, N. Y., has consented to act as the distributer
of information in respect to the working
of this plan and after the Conference at Winona
this year literature will be issued which will give
data concerning what some of us believe promises
to be a mighty factor in the Church’s progress in
the years to come. In all these congregations
where this plan has been given a fair trial it has
wrought wonders and the testimonies that will
soon be at your disposal will be a revelation, I
judge, to many who have been in despair almost
over the problem of financing the kingdom. It
will show that God has a plan and that the plan
will meet the needs of the Church to-day, as it
always has in the past, when honestly administered.
No congregation need fear to give it a
fair trial. As the colored preacher said, “I hab
nebber known a church killed by too much gibbin
to de Lawd. If der should be such a church,
and I should know about it, I’ll tell you what I’d
do. I’d go to dat church, and I’d clamber up its
moss-covered roof, and I’d sit straddle of its ridge
pole, and I’d cry aloud, ‘Blessed am de dead dat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
die in de Lawd.’” If any one tries this method
and faithfully proves the Lord therewith, and
then goes under, it certainly will be time to say,
“Blessed am de dead dat die in de Lawd.”</p>

<p>Many give more than the tenth and should do
so. I know some who give one-fifth, and higher
proportions up to that height attained by one
whom it has been my privilege to meet who gives
nine-tenths of his income and lives on the one-tenth.
When we have paid our due to the Lord,
we still have nine-tenths out of which to meet the
call of the gospel in such words as these, “Give
good measure. Freely ye have received, freely
give. Abound in this grace. Sell that thou hast
and give to the poor.” A man once gave such a
large gift to missions as to call forth words of
surprise. He said, “It is one-quarter of what I
own. I found that as I was prospered my money
engrossed more and more of my thoughts. I am
not going to be a slave to the money God gave
me, and I am going to conquer the love of money
by giving it away.” That was in accord with
the word of Christ to the rich young ruler and
any one who is becoming a slave of money ought
not only to give a tenth, but might better give a
quarter or a half or even all his money away,
rather than die as the fool died who laid up treasure
for himself and was not rich toward God.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Christ commended the widow who gave all and
cared for her as he will for all who honor Him
with their substance. The tithe has been given by
all races and conditions in the past and no objection
on account of race or condition can hold
against it now.</p>

<p>While we might have cut short much debate by
saying that the tithe is not a Jewish institution
but is an ancient law of the race and we are no
more called upon to prove its obligation than we
are that of the law of the Sabbath or of marriage,
yet we have tried to present the case as briefly
and yet thoroughly as possible within reasonable
limits. But, as I said at Winona last year, suppose
you deny all this evidence and refuse to be
convinced of its obligation, there is one plea that
you cannot gainsay. It is the one system that has
never failed to get the money. The history of the
past shows this. The enemies of the Evangelical
Church recognize it. The Mormons, the Seventh
Day Adventists, the Dowieites all find the tithe
sufficient to carry on their wonderful propagandas
and demonstrate the argument that God’s tenth
if rightly used by His Church would enable us
soon to take the world for Christ. All other
methods of raising money pale into insignificance
when compared with this which has always, in
all ages, and among all classes of peoples proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
sufficient to do great things in the name of the
religion or irreligion in behalf of which it was
used. The simple argument, It works, ought to
appeal to the many struggling Church workers
who are at their wits’ end to know how to meet
expenses. That mere tithe-paying will bring
spiritual blessing, I do not claim. The reverse is
true, as the Pharisee testifies. But tithing according
to God’s plan and in the spirit which He
has laid down in His word must and will bring
great blessing.</p>

<p>One of our missionaries in India tells of a
native who was an earnest Christian and a believer
in tithing. He had a friend who was converted
and he was anxious to have him tithe also.
After some effort to persuade him and seemingly
without avail, he gave his friend a sound thrashing
and enforced the tithe by brawn and not by
persuasion of conscience. This was zeal without
knowledge. You can no more make a man give
than you can make him pray. You can make a
man say words, but it is not prayer. You may
make him hand out money unwillingly, but that
is not giving as I view it. I like to define giving
as follows: Giving is a cheerful, willing, liberal,
intelligent, quiet, regular and prayerful exercise
of a God-given grace. This grace of giving, like
all God’s gifts, comes with the asking and stays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
with the using. It is no more possible for a man
to have the grace of giving without asking for it
and making proper use of it, than it is to have the
Spirit for service without asking for and making
use of that gift. I would not attempt to force
this system on any unprayerful person or people.
But, Oh that the Church might awake to its glorious
provision and its wonderful privilege in this
conformity to the law of giving! When a man
asks for the grace of giving and receives the impulse
to open his purse to abound in this grace,
then comes to him God’s rule, The Tenth is holy
unto Me as a first-fruit of this grace, and immediately
he begins to see where it is that a man
crosses over the boundary line of selfishness and
steps into the plane of devotion to God, and he
takes the step and rejoices in it. As he walks on
in the glad consciousness of duty done, he begins
to rejoice in larger manifestations of this grace
and meets other and larger opportunities for the
gospel’s sake and for the Master’s sake, and thus
the fulness of the blessing of this grace flows into
his soul and he knows the meaning of abounding
in this grace also.</p>

<p>What has been said of individual experience,
may be just as truly said of the experience that
comes to any congregation that will follow this
same plan of God, as some of our congregations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
can testify. The blessing is not only financial,
but it is spiritual in a large and increasing sense.
Would that John Knox might stir up the ministry
now as he is said to have done in his day in
Scotland when he said, “There is no impiety
against which it is more requisite you set yourselves
in this time. Repent, therefore, and amend
your own neglect in this behalf and call upon
others for amendment.” Max Mueller is said
also to have written to a young minister, “When
one thinks what this world of ours would be, if
at least this minimum of Christianity were a reality,
one feels that you are right in preaching this
simple duty in season and out of season, until
people see that without fulfilling it, every other
profession of religion is a mere sham.”</p>

<p>The ringing words of Bishop Potter at the dedication
of Grace Chapel in New York city, while
they may apply peculiarly to the Episcopal
Church, yet are wholesome words to all God’s
people.</p>

<p>“The growth of wealth and of luxury, wicked,
wasteful, and wanton, as before God I declare
that luxury to be, has been matched step by step
by a deepening and deadening poverty which has
left whole neighborhoods of people practically
without hope and without aspiration. At such a
time, for the church of God to sit still and be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
content with theories of its duty outlawed by time
and long ago demonstrated to be grotesquely inadequate
to the demands of a living situation, this
is to deserve the scorn of men and the curse of
God! Take my word for it, men and brethren,
unless you and I and all those who have any gift
or stewardship of talents, or means, of whatsoever
sort, are willing to get up out of our sloth and
ease and selfish dilettanteism of service, and get
down among the people who are battling amid
their poverty and ignorance—young girls for
their chastity, young men for their better ideal of
righteousness, old and young alike for one clear
ray of the immortal courage and the immortal
hope—then verily the church in its stately splendor,
its apostolic orders, its venerable ritual, its
decorous and dignified conventions, is revealed as
simply a monstrous and insolent impertinence!”</p>

<p>Seeing that this indictment is well placed, why
should not any person or people pay to God at
least the tenth, as His minimum requirement?
The need has not ceased. We have the poor with
us. The ministry is appointed to live by the gospel.
The field is not Judea alone, but the world.
Opportunities of beneficence are multifold. Men
are waiting and hungering for the gospel. Men
are longing to take it to them. Means we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
have. Our greatest need, as before stated, from
the human side is money, not men or machinery.</p>

<p>As Mr. Gladstone said, “The inculcation and
practice of systematic beneficence will prove the
moral specific for this age.” Will the people rob
God? “Bring ye the whole tithe into the storehouse,
that there may be meat in mine house, and
prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts,
if I will not open you the windows of heaven and
pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be
room enough to receive it.” Why not make the
test? Then God even our own God will bless us
with the riches of His grace, to whom be glory in
the Church of Jesus Christ throughout all ages,
world without end. Amen.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> Yes, I know the stock answer to this. “Jacob’s Vow.” But
what and where was Jacob when he used this language? A
sneak and a fugitive from the just wrath of his brother. It is safe
to say that never afterwards, certainly never after he became an
honest man did he speak of or regard the payment of the Tithe
as a “gift” to God. It looks as though the Pharisee boasted of
giving Tithes, but there is no use in painting him blacker than
he was. Let us hope he had in mind that he gave tithes to the
Temple service, in which case the word he used was correct. It
is unfair to charge even him with claiming that he gave Tithes
to God. So far as I recall Christ never mentioned Tithes but
twice. Once He said “Ye tithe;” in the other instance “Ye pay
tithes,” and added his approval.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> After the above was written, the following came to my notice
from Prof. Sayce in a late work entitled, “The Religions of
Ancient Egypt and Babylonia.” In speaking of the custom of
the authorities, he says, “A tithe of all that the land produced
was theirs, and it was rigorously exacted, for the support of the
temples and priests. Babylonia, in short, was the inventor of
the tithe.”</p>

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
